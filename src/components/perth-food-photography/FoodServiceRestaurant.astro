      Amplify Creative Lab is a Perth-based commercial photography studio providing
      food photography for restaurants, cafés, bars and hospitality brands across
      Western Australia. We create menu-ready hero images, interiors and lifestyle
      content designed to lift bookings and online orders.
    </p>

    <p>
      We create high-impact visuals for restaurants, cafés, and hospitality
      brands. From hero dishes to menu-ready plates, our goal is simple: increase
      appetite appeal and drive more bookings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t let bland photos hurt your business.
      <strong>
        If your menu, Google Business Profile, or Uber Eats listings rely on
        low-quality images, you’re leaving sales on the table.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We deliver premium photography for Perth venues—from full-table spreads to
      interior lifestyle shots. We capture your plated dishes, chefs, and
      atmosphere so diners can experience your brand before they walk in.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Stress-free process:</strong>
      We work around your service times and bring professional lighting to you, ensuring
      your team can focus on the food while we create imagery that sells.
