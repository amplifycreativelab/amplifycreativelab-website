      <strong>On-site portraits during events:</strong>
      We create professional portraits of speakers, executives, teams and VIPs during
      corporate and hospitality events, ideal for LinkedIn profiles, media use and
      marketing assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Calm, guided experience:</strong>
      Whether we&apos;re photographing a keynote speaker, a small team or a couple
      celebrating a milestone, we provide gentle direction so people feel relaxed
      and confident in front of the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other photography on request:</strong>
      While event and commercial work are our main focus, we do take on a limited
      number of portrait and family sessions outside of events. If you love our style,
      get in touch and we&apos;ll let you know if we&apos;re available for your project.
