        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the photography services
          provided by Amplify Creative Lab ("we", "us", or "our") to you ("the
          Client"). By booking a shoot or paying a deposit, you agree to be
          bound by these Terms.

        <h2>2. Bookings and Payments</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Booking Fee:</strong> To secure your date or session, a non-refundable
          booking fee (typically 50% of the total quote) is required. No booking is
          confirmed until this fee is paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Balance:</strong> The remaining balance is due prior to the delivery
          of the final high-resolution images.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Invoices:</strong> Invoices must be paid within 7 days of issue
          unless otherwise agreed in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>GST:</strong> All quoted prices include GST where applicable under
          Australian tax law.

        <h2>3. Cancellations and Rescheduling</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Client Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel within 48 hours of the
          scheduled shoot, the booking fee is forfeited to cover our loss of business.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescheduling:</strong> We understand that life happens. One reschedule
          is permitted without penalty if requested more than 48 hours in advance.
          Subsequent reschedules may incur a re-booking fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Weather:</strong> For outdoor shoots, we reserve the right to reschedule
          due to inclement weather (for example, heavy rain or storms) at no extra
          cost.

          systems).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Restrictions:</strong> You may not sell the images to third parties
