**Target Audience:** Restaurant Owners, Café Managers, Bar Owners, Product Founders and Event Planners in Perth (Perth CBD, Northbridge, Fremantle, Subiaco, Leederville, Mount Lawley).

## GLOBAL SEO & STYLE GUIDELINES (For Developers/Writers)

- **Tone of Voice:** Professional, authoritative, yet approachable.  
  *Positioning:* “We are the tech-savvy artists” – we understand both visuals *and* code.

- **Personas to Keep in Mind:**
  - **Restaurant Owner:** Wants more bookings, better online presence, and clear ROI.
  - **Café Manager:** Needs better menu photos, Instagram-ready visuals, and a simple website that’s easy to update.
  - **Venue / Event Manager:** Needs launch/event coverage, landing pages, and long-tail content from photos.
  - **Product Founder (CPG/Food Brand):** Needs packshots, e-commerce-ready imagery, and a conversion-driven site.

- **Search Intent Types We Target:**
  - **Informational:** “How to improve restaurant website”, “food photography tips”.
  - **Commercial Intent:** “Perth restaurant web design pricing”, “hire food photographer Perth”.
  - **Local SEO:** “restaurant web design Perth”, “food photographer Fremantle”.
  - **Case Study / Proof:** “before and after food photography”, “website speed case study”.

- **Location Strategy:** Use local variants naturally:
  - “Perth hospitality”, “Northbridge cafés”, “Fremantle restaurants”, “WA food scene”, “Perth venues”, “Perth bars”.

- **Image Optimization Standards:**
  - Format: **WebP** (fallback to JPG as needed).
  - Dimensions:
    - Hero: Max width ~1920px.
    - Body images: Up to ~800–900px wide.
  - Compression: Lossy, ~80–85% quality.
  - **CRITICAL:** All images **must** have descriptive, human-readable alt text that naturally includes local/hospitality keywords where relevant.

- **Structural Guidelines:**
  - Intro: 1–2 short paragraphs clearly stating the problem for Perth venues.
  - Use `h2` for main sections, `h3` for sub-sections.
  - Paragraphs: 2–4 sentences max (for readability).
  - Use `<strong>` and `<em>` on key buying phrases (e.g. *Perth restaurant website*, *food photography shoot*, *Core Web Vitals*), not random words.

- **Call to Action (CTA):**
  - Every article must end with:
    - A **clear textual CTA** in the body (e.g., “Book a free menu audit”).
    - A link to the **most relevant service page** or `/#work-with-us` so there is always a concrete next step.
  - Recommended recurring CTAs:
    - “Book a free menu audit”
    - “Request a web + photo quote”
    - “See our Perth food photography portfolio”
    - “Test your website speed and get a mini audit”

# CORE PILLAR ARTICLES (FOUNDATION POSTS)

These four articles are the **primary pillars** for the blog. All other content should cluster around them via internal links.

---

## ARTICLE 1: THE REVENUE PILLAR (Web Design Focus)

**Concept:** Attack the “PDF Menu” problem. It is the #1 issue for users and bad for SEO. This highlights your web development skills and the value of mobile-first design.

### 1. Metadata

- **Proposed Title:** Why Your PDF Menu is Killing Your Google Ranking (And What to Use Instead)
- **URL Slug:** `/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo`
- **Target Keyword:** Restaurant web design Perth, Mobile friendly menu, SEO for cafes
- **Meta Description:**  
  Still using a PDF menu for your Perth restaurant? Learn why it hurts your SEO and frustrates diners, and how a responsive web menu drives more bookings.

### 2. Content Outline

- **H1:** The "PDF Pinch": Why Mobile Diners Hate Your Current Menu

- **Intro:**  
  Hook the reader with a scenario: A hungry customer in Northbridge tries to load your menu on 4G. It’s a tiny PDF, they have to pinch-zoom, it takes ages to download, they get frustrated and tap on a competitor instead.

- **H2: The SEO Problem with PDFs**
  - Explain that Google cannot easily "read" individual dishes inside an image-based PDF.
  - Explain that PDF clicks often behave like a “dead end” and can look like a bounce in analytics.
  - Mention how PDFs rarely support structured data (no proper `Menu` schema, no per-dish visibility).

- **H2: The User Experience (UX) Nightmare**
  - Data point angle: a high percentage of restaurant searches happen on mobile.
  - PDFs require downloading extra data (bad for tourists, mobile data caps, weak reception).
  - Accessibility issues: small text, pinch-zooming, poor readability in bright daylight.
  - Framing: "You’re making hungry people work too hard to give you money."

- **H2: The Solution – HTML/Responsive Menus**
  - Explain how you build menus directly into the site’s code, grouped by section (Starters, Mains, Desserts, Drinks).
  - Benefits:
    - Fast loading, no downloads.
    - Searchable text (great for SEO & “gluten free pizza in Perth” type queries).
    - Easier to update prices and seasonal items.
    - Better accessibility (larger text, contrast, headings).

- **H3: Visuals Matter – Pairing Code with Photography**
  - Show how a code-based menu allows:
    - Dish photos inline or in pop-ups.
    - Hover or tap-to-expand images.
    - Highlighting best-sellers and chef’s recommendations.
  - Upsell: you can handle both the design and the food photography, so there’s no gap between visuals and implementation.

- **Conclusion:**  
  Wrap up with the idea: “Stop making your customers pinch-zoom to see your food. A mobile-first menu is one of the simplest ways to get more bookings.”

- **CTA:**  
  “Need to convert your PDF into a mobile-first website? [Book a free menu audit](/#work-with-us) and we’ll review your current site and menu.”

### 3. Visual Brief & Alt Text

- **Hero Image:**

## ARTICLE 2: THE VISUAL PILLAR (Food Photography Focus)

**Concept:** Prove that "good enough" smartphone photos are losing venues money and that professional photography + optimized web delivery = higher conversions.

### 1. Metadata

- **URL Slug:** `/blog/roi-professional-food-photography-perth`
- **Target Keyword:** Food photographer Perth, Menu styling, Hospitality branding
- **Meta Description:**  
  Can customers taste your food through their screen? Discover how professional food photography increases menu conversion rates for Perth cafés, bars and restaurants.

### 2. Content Outline

- **H1:** Why Your iPhone Photos Are Costing You Tables

- **Intro:**  
  The first bite is visual. In the age of Instagram, UberEats and Google Maps, if it doesn’t look good, it doesn’t get ordered. Set up a scenario: two similar venues, one with professional photos, one with dim, yellow smartphone shots.

- **H2: The Psychology of “Appetite Appeal”**
  - Discuss how light, colour, texture and detail affect appetite.
  - Mention elements like steam, glistening sauces, crisp edges, and fresh garnishes.
  - Explain how you use composition and depth of field to make dishes look premium.

- **H2: Case Study – Before and After**
  - **CRITICAL SECTION:** Show a “User Generated Content” photo vs your professional shot of the same dish.
  - Analyse the difference:
    - Lighting quality.
    - Styling and props.
    - Colour balance and exposure.
    - Background (clutter vs clean).
  - Include simple, concrete outcomes:
    - More clicks on a dish.
    - Higher average order value.
    - Improved perception of the brand.

- **H2: Integrating Photos into Web Design**
  - Connect visuals with performance:
    - High-quality photos that are properly sized and compressed.
    - Use of modern formats (WebP) and responsive image sizes.
    - Ensuring images don’t slow down the menu or homepage.
  - Frame it as a unique advantage: most photographers don’t understand Core Web Vitals, most devs don’t understand styling. You do both.

- **H3: Styling for the Perth Market**
  - Mention local trends:
    - Natural light and coastal vibes (Fremantle, Scarborough, Cottesloe).
    - Industrial chic for city venues (Perth CBD, Northbridge).
    - Rustic and earthy for wine bars and small bars.
  - Show that you understand Perth’s hospitality scene, not just generic food shots.

  Reinforce: “Your food is premium. Your photos – and the way they load online – should be too.”

- **CTA:**  
  “Ready to upgrade your visual menu? [Book a half-day food photography shoot](/perth-food-photography) and we’ll plan a shoot tailored to your venue.”

### 2. Content Outline

- **H1:** The Digital Checklist for Your Grand Opening

- **Intro:**  
  Perth is a competitive market. A soft launch isn’t enough anymore. You need digital “noise” before, during and after opening night.

    - Lifestyle shots in context (bars, tables, outdoor locations).

    - Collect emails before launch.

- **Intro:**  
  Attention spans are short. If your menu doesn’t load quickly, customers go to UberEats (and you pay ~30% commission) or choose a faster competitor site.

- **H2: What Are Core Web Vitals?**
  - Simple definitions of:
    - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
    - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

# IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR DEVS

1. **Schema Markup (JSON-LD):**  
   - All posts already output `BlogPosting` schema via `BlogPostLayout.astro`.  
   - Make sure every article defines accurate:
     - `title`
     - `description`
     - `publishDate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
     - `canonicalUrl`
   - For **Article 1** and **Article 2**, if you add a Q&A section, include an additional `FAQPage` JSON-LD block in the `.astro` file, following the pattern in `src/pages/faq.astro` (see `faqSchema` and `stripHtml` there).

2. **Open Graph Tags (BaseLayout):**  
   - `BaseLayout.astro` currently uses a default `og:image` (`/images/social/share-default.png`) for all pages.  
   - If a blog post needs a custom OG image:
     - Add an `ogImage` prop to `BaseLayout`.
     - Pass each post’s `featuredImage` from `BlogPostLayout.astro`.
   - Result: Social shares (LinkedIn/Facebook) show the **same hero image** as the article.

3. **Internal Linking Strategy (Real Routes in This Repo):**

   - **Web design & performance topics (Articles 1 & 4):**
     - Link to `/website-development` when:
       - Talking about rebuilding sites or fixing PDFs/menus.
       - Discussing speed and performance improvements.
     - Use anchor text like:
       - “Perth restaurant website design”
       - “mobile-first online menus”
       - “fast hospitality websites”
     - When inviting people to contact, link to the home CTA: `/#work-with-us`.

   - **Food photography topics (Article 2):**
     - Link to `/perth-food-photography` when discussing shoots, menu imagery and styling.
     - Link to `/portfolio` when referencing real example work or “see our food photography portfolio”.

   - **Launch / authority topics (Article 3):**
     - Link to `/perth-product-photography` for packshots and e-commerce imagery.
     - Link to `/perth-event-photography` for launch parties, events and ongoing coverage.

   - **Cross-blog linking:**
     - From speed articles → link back to the PDF menu pillar when mentioning performance.
     - From photography articles → link to the technical pillar when talking about optimization.
     - From launch content → link to both photography and web design pillars.

4. **On-Page Formatting in `.astro` Posts**

   - Follow the structure in `food-photography-tips-restaurants.astro`:
     - 1–2 short intro paragraphs.
     - `h2` for main sections, `h3` for nested subsections.
     - Short paragraphs, generous whitespace.
   - Use semantic HTML:
     - `ul`/`ol` for lists.
     - `<strong>` and `<em>` around key commercial phrases.
   - Always end with:
     - A body CTA sentence.
     - A link to the relevant service or `/#work-with-us`.

---

# REPO-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (ASTRO BLOG SYSTEM)

## 1. Blog File Structure

- All blog posts are `.astro` files in `src/pages/blog/`.  
  - Example: `food-photography-tips-restaurants.astro` → `/blog/food-photography-tips-restaurants/`
- Use `.astro` posts (not `.md`) so we can control:
  - Layout
  - Metadata
  - Schema via `BlogPostLayout.astro`
- Slugs: short, descriptive, lower-case with hyphens:
  - `pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo.astro`
  - `website-speed-optimization-perth.astro`
  - `roi-professional-food-photography-perth.astro`, etc.

## 2. Mapping This Plan to `BlogPostLayout.astro`

Every article must define a `post: BlogPost` object and pass it into `<BlogPostLayout {...post}>`. Map planning fields to props like this:

- **Title** → `title`  
  - Use a clear, benefit-driven headline. This is also used as the hero `<img>` alt.
- **Meta Description** → `description`  
  - Aim for ~140–155 characters; front-load “Perth”, “restaurant”, “café”, “web design”, “food photography” etc.
- **Publish Date** → `publishDate` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Category** → `category`  
  - Suggested categories:
    - `Food Photography`
    - `Web Design`
    - `Product Photography`
    - `Event Photography`
    - `Branding`
    - `Performance`
    - `Local SEO`
    - `Case Study`
- **Read Time** → `readTime` such as `"6 min read"` or `"8 min read"`.
- **Hero Image URL** → `featuredImage` (e.g. `/images/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-hero.jpg`).
- **Tags** → `tags` array mixing topic + intent + location, for example:
  - `["Restaurant Web Design", "Mobile Menus", "Perth"]`
  - `["Food Photography", "Restaurant Marketing", "Perth Cafes"]`
- **Canonical URL** → `canonicalUrl`, built like:

  ```ts
  const canonicalUrl = new URL(
    "/blog/your-article-slug/",
    "https://amplifycreativelab.com"
  ).toString();


IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR DEVS
Framework Recommendation (Astro Content Collections):

Strongly Recommended: Move from standard .astro pages to Content Collections (src/content/blog/*.mdx).

Why? It allows you to enforce a schema (Title, Date, Image, Description) so you never break your SEO data. It scales better as the blog grows.

Schema Markup (JSON-LD):

Ensure every article defines accurate title, description, publishDate, and canonicalUrl.

For Article 1 and Article 2, consider adding FAQPage schema if you include a Q&A section.

The <Image /> Component (Crucial):

Do not use standard HTML <img> tags for blog content.

Use Astro's <Image /> component.

Benefit: It automatically generates the correct width/height to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)—a key point in Article 4.

Internal Linking Strategy:

Web design/speed topics: Link to /website-development. Anchor text: “Perth restaurant website design”, “mobile-first online menus”.

Photography topics: Link to /perth-food-photography or /portfolio.

Launch topics: Link to /perth-product-photography or /perth-event-photography.

Cross-linking: Speed articles must link to PDF menu articles; Photography articles must link to Technical optimization articles.

On-Page Formatting:

Use semantic HTML (ul, ol, h2, h3).

Use <strong> on key commercial phrases for scanning, but don't overdo it.

Always end with a body CTA sentence + link.
