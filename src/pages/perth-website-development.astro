              We choose tools based on your needs, focusing on performance,
              maintainability and SEO. This can include modern frameworks like
              Astro.js, CMS options like Decap CMS, and booking integrations

            </summary>
            <p class="webdev-faq__answer">
              We prefer <strong>Astro.js</strong> because it creates websites that are significantly faster, more secure, and easier to maintain than standard WordPress sites.
              <br /><br />
              While we can use WordPress if requested, we find it often becomes bloated with plugins that hurt performance. Astro allows us to deliver a top-tier, high-performance site that Google loves.

              Timelines vary with scope, but smaller sites are typically
