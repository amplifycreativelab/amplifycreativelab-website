      <strong>Pre-event planning:</strong>
      We start by understanding your event goals – whether it&apos;s a brand
      activation, product launch, conference, networking night or hospitality
      function. We&apos;ll review your run sheet and key moments so nothing
      important is missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Discreet, story-driven coverage:</strong>
      On the day, we blend into the crowd while capturing genuine interactions,
      speaker moments, crowd reactions, detail shots and room atmosphere. Our
      approach is candid and documentary-led, with just enough direction for
      essential group photos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fast delivery for marketing &amp; socials:</strong>
      You&apos;ll receive a curated gallery of edited images ready for websites,
      reports, email campaigns and social media. We can prioritise a small
      preview set if you need content for same-day or next-day posting.
