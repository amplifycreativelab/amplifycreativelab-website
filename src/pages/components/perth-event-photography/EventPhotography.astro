      <strong>Pre-shoot Consultation:</strong>
      We begin with a questionnaire to understand your love story, wedding
      details, and specific preferences. Following this, we’ll have a phone
      call (or an in-person meeting) to discuss your vision and answer any
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shooting Day:</strong>
      On your wedding day, we’ll be on standby for up to four hours (with actual
      shooting time typically less than two hours) to capture every authentic
      and memorable moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Post-shoot Delivery:</strong>
      Within 48 hours, you’ll receive a preview of your photos. The full set,
      including up to 20 refined and 100 edited photos, will be delivered within
      two weeks. Additionally, you’ll receive one edited video lasting 3–5
      minutes.
