      <strong>Pre-Shoot Communication:</strong>
      During our email consultation, we will discuss your vision for the shoot
      and address any questions you may have. We will also suggest beautiful
      outdoor locations tailored to your preferences and the current season.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Outdoor Photography:</strong>
      Choose from 30-minute mini sessions or 45-minute standard sessions. We will
      guide you through capturing authentic moments and beautiful smiles with
      gentle prompts and creative guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Post-Shoot Magic:</strong>
      After the session, you will receive 30 or 60 beautifully edited photos,
      depending on the package chosen, along with a selection of unedited
      photos. All images will be provided in high-resolution JPEG format,
      allowing you to relive the entire shoot experience.
