    <p>
      Static packshots are great for clarity, but lifestyle images are what make people imagine using your products.
    </p>
    <p>
      We style scenes that show your drinks being poured, packaging in context and products being shared —
      perfect for social media, campaigns and hero banners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>On-location or in studio:</strong>
      We can shoot in your venue, on location or in a controlled studio setup depending on your concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Story-first approach:</strong>
      Every image is designed to communicate how your product fits into your customer’s life.
