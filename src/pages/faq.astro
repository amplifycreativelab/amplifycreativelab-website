          <p>
            Amplify Creative Lab is a Perth photography studio based in Doubleview,
            and we service the entire Perth metropolitan area.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For restaurants &amp; events:</strong> We come to you. Whether you are in the CBD,
            Fremantle or the northern suburbs, we bring our mobile studio lighting to your venue so
            you can keep service running smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For products:</strong> Our studio workflow is optimised for efficiency. You can drop off
            products at our Doubleview studio, or mail them to us from anywhere in Australia as part of our
            “Ship &amp; Shoot” service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Travel fees:</strong> Travel within the standard Perth metro area is included. If your business
            or wedding is located in regional Western Australia (for example, Margaret River or the Swan Valley),
            get in touch for a custom travel quote based on time and distance.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1. Enquiry:</strong> Fill out the
              <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> with a few details about your project
              (type of shoot, location, preferred dates and any deadlines).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2. Consultation:</strong> We will have a quick chat via email or phone
              to make sure we are the right fit and to clarify your goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3. Deposit:</strong> To secure your date we require a
              <strong>50% non-refundable deposit</strong>. This locks in our team and equipment for your time slot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4. Balance:</strong> The remaining 50% is due on the day of the photoshoot
              (or prior for some commercial bookings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>5. Invoices:</strong> We provide full tax invoices for all payments,
              suitable for Australian business tax claims.

          <p>
            We understand that life happens and staff get sick, so we aim to be as flexible as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rescheduling:</strong> If you notify us at least <strong>48 hours in advance</strong>,
            we can transfer your deposit to a new date within the next 3 months (subject to availability).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> For outdoor portrait sessions, if Perth’s weather turns bad
            (heavy rain or storms), we will make the call to reschedule at no extra cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel completely, the 50% deposit acts as a cancellation fee
            to cover the time we held for you and any pre-production work already completed.

              Our website projects are structured so you know exactly what you are getting. A typical engagement includes:

              Timelines depend on scope, but most small business websites take <strong>4–8 weeks</strong> from signed proposal
              to launch, provided content and feedback are supplied on time.

        answer: `
            <p>
              Yes. If your current site is built on a common platform (such as WordPress or a modern site builder), we can either
              redesign within that ecosystem or migrate you to a more <strong>performance-focused setup</strong> while preserving
              your domain and search visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              During our discovery call we will look at what is already working, what is holding you back (speed, UX, SEO or visuals)
              and whether a refresh or full rebuild makes the most sense for your goals and budget.

            Absolutely. We regularly create <strong>Uber Eats photography</strong> and menu images
            for delivery platforms including Uber Eats, DoorDash and Menulog.
          </p>

        question: "Do I need to close my restaurant for the photoshoot?",
        answer: `
          <p>
            Not necessarily. Many venues stay open during their shoot, but we do recommend
            scheduling photography during <strong>off‑peak hours</strong>
            (for example, early morning or between lunch and dinner service).
          </p>
          <p>
            Shooting during quieter times gives us space to set up lights without getting in the way
            of your team, and allows your kitchen staff to focus fully on plating each dish perfectly
            without the pressure of docket orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are unsure about the best time, we can advise based on your style of venue and the
            type of imagery you need for your website or delivery platforms.

        answer: `
          <p>
            We generally split food photography into two main approaches, which can also be combined
            in the same session:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Styled (studio / product):</strong> This is where we control everything. We use props,
            precise lighting and food styling techniques to make a burger look juicy, a drink look frosty
            or desserts pop on a clean background. Styled images are perfect for menus, websites,
            packaging and advertising.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Lifestyle (venue / documentary):</strong> This captures the <em>vibe</em> of your venue.
            Think the chef cooking on the pass, the bartender pouring cocktails, or guests enjoying the space.
            Lifestyle imagery is essential for social media and your website to show the atmosphere and story
            behind your food.
          </p>
        `,
      },
      {
        question:
          'Who creates the "Creative Content Plan" mentioned in the packages?',
        answer: `
          <p>
            We create your <strong>Creative Content Plan</strong> collaboratively with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the shoot we review your current social media, website and competitors.
            From there we propose a tailored shot list&mdash;for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>5 hero dishes or drinks for your menu and website</li>
            <li>3 staff or chef portraits for “About” and social posts</li>
            <li>2–4 interior or venue vibe shots</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This ensures you receive a mix of hero images and day‑to‑day content that can fill your
            Instagram grid and marketing channels for the next month or more.

            We specialise in <strong>prompt‑based posing</strong> rather than stiff, formal posing.
            Instead of “stand here and smile”, we might ask you to walk, chat, laugh or interact with your
            partner or kids. This creates genuine, candid moments where you look like yourself,

        question: "What should we wear for a family or portrait session?",

          <p>
            We recommend <strong>coordinating, not matching</strong>. Aim for colours and textures that
            work together without everyone wearing the exact same outfit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid large logos or heavy patterns that can distract from faces. Earthy tones (beiges, greens,
            rusts) tend to look beautiful in Perth’s outdoor locations, while solid block colours work best
            for studio portraits.

        question: "Do you offer Mini Sessions?",
        answer: `
          <p>
            Yes. We offer 30‑minute <strong>Mini Sessions</strong> specifically designed for families who
            want a quick update without the time commitment of a full session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mini Sessions are perfect for families with young children, busy professionals needing fresh
            headshots, or couples wanting a few great images for announcements.

        question: 'What is the "All Good Original Photos" inclusion?',
        answer: `
          <p>
            Most photographers only supply a small set of final edited images (for example, 10–20 photos).
            We know that for social media you need <strong>volume</strong> as well as hero shots.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Amplify Creative Lab you receive:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A curated gallery of <strong>lightly colour‑corrected “Original” JPEGs</strong> (your
              “All Good Original Photos”) that are perfect for Instagram, TikTok, Reels and stories.
            </li>
            <li>
              A set of <strong>fully retouched images</strong> ideal for your website, campaigns and ads.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This gives you both polished hero imagery and plenty of day‑to‑day content to keep your
            brand visible online.

      },
      {
        question: "How long do you keep my photos?",
        answer: `
          <p>
            We keep a backup of your final edited images for at least <strong>6 months</strong> after the shoot.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strongly recommend downloading your gallery as soon as it is delivered and backing it up
            to at least one external hard drive or cloud storage service. While we do our best to archive
            projects, we cannot guarantee storage beyond this period.

        question: "Who owns the copyright to the images?",
        answer: `
          <p>
            Under Australian Copyright Law, Amplify Creative Lab retains the copyright to the images
            we create. However, we grant you a broad, practical usage licence so you can actually use
            the work you have commissioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>You can:</strong> use the photos on your website, social media, menus, printed materials
            and advertising indefinitely for your own business.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>You cannot:</strong> sell or sublicence the photos to third parties (for example, stock
            photo sites or other businesses) without our written permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a specific licensing question (for example, national campaigns or usage by partners),
            please mention it in your enquiry so we can advise on the best option.
