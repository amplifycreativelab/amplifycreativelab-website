faq:
  - question: "How long does a restaurant photo shoot take?"
    answer: "A standard menu shoot (10-15 dishes) typically takes 3-4 hours. A full brand shoot (interiors, portraits, cocktails, food) is usually a full day (6-8 hours). Rushing a shoot compromises lighting and plating quality."
  - question: "Should I close my restaurant for the shoot?"
    answer: "Ideally, yes, or shoot during closed hours (e.g., Monday lunch). Shooting during service is stressful for kitchen staff and limits the photographer's ability to control lighting. If you must stay open, choose your quietest time."
  - question: "Do I need to cook the food differently for photos?"
    answer: "Yes. Food for photos ('hero food') should be slightly undercooked (vegetables look brighter, meat holds shape better) and plated with extreme care. Sauces should be added at the last second on set to prevent skinning or absorption."
  - question: "How many dishes can we photograph in an hour?"
    answer: "Expect 4-5 high-quality styled shots per hour. If shots are simple e-commerce style on white, we can do more. Complex lifestyle shots with talent take longer."

Great food photography doesn't happen by accident. That effortless shot of steam rising from a perfectly seared steak? It was likely planned weeks in advance, scheduled to the minute, and styled with precision.

For Perth venue owners, a professional photoshoot is a significant investment. To get the best ROI, you need to manage it like a project. Here is your step-by-step planning guide.

## Phase 1: The Brief & Objectives

Before booking a photographer, define success.

*   **Usage:** Where will these images live? Website hero banners (landscape), Instagram Stories (portrait), or Uber Eats (square)?
*   **Style:** Dark and moody (like a CBD whiskey bar) or bright and coastal (like a Cottesloe cafe)?
*   **Key Message:** Are you selling "freshness", "generosity", "technical skill", or "atmosphere"?

*Tip: Create a mood board on Pinterest or save Instagram posts from other Perth venues you admire to show your photographer.*

## Phase 2: The Mighty Shot List

Never "wing it". Create a spreadsheet with three columns:

1.  **Must Haves:** The reason for the shoot (e.g., new seasonal menu items, hero cocktail).
2.  **Nice to Haves:** Staff portraits, interior details, ingredients.
3.  **If Time Permits:** Social media filler content.

**For each shot, specify:**
*   Dish Name
*   Key Ingredients to Highlight (e.g., "Show the crispy skin")
*   Orientation (Portrait/Landscape)
*   Props needed (e.g., "Pour sauce on camera")

## Phase 3: Kitchen & Staff Prep

Cooking for the camera is different from cooking for a customer.

### The "Hero Dish" Approach
*   **Undercook vegetables:** They retain colour and turgidity better.
*   **Hold the sauce:** Bring sauce in a separate jug to pour on set.
*   **Pick the prettiest produce:** Save the most perfect bun, the freshest herbs, and the best steak cut for the lens.

### Staffing
*   **The Chef:** Assign one chef *exclusively* to the shoot. They cannot work the line and the shoot simultaneously.
*   **The runner:** Have someone to run dishes, clear plates, and grab extra napkins/props.

## Phase 4: The Day-of Schedule

Time flies on set. Use a run sheet to keep on track.

| Time | Activity | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8:00 AM** | Setup & Lighting | Coffee for crew! |
| **9:00 AM** | Ambient/Interiors | Shoot wide shots before food arrives |
| **10:00 AM** | Hero Dishes (Batch 1) | Cold items first (salads, raw) |
| **12:00 PM** | Hot Dishes (Batch 2) | Steam/Smoke shots |
| **2:00 PM** | Cocktails/Bevs | Ice melts fast—shoot these last |
| **3:00 PM** | Staff Portraits | Clean uniforms required |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1.  **Shooting during service:** Ideally, shoot on a closed day. If not, section off a "no-go zone" for the photographer.
2.  **Forgetting props:** Do you have nice linen napkins? Textured plates? Ask your agency if they bring these (we do).
3.  **Dirty surfaces:** Deep clean the tables and floor *before* the photographer arrives. Photoshop can remove crumbs, but it takes time away from shooting more dishes.

## Check Your Tech Specs

Ensure you ask for the right deliverables:
*   [Web-optimised files](/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth) (WebP) for your site.
*   High-res JPEGs for print menus.
*   Video clips (if part of the package) for Reels.
