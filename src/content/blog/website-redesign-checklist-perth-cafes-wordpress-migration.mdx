faq:
  - question: "How long does it take to migrate a café website from WordPress?"
    answer: "A typical Perth café website migration takes 4-8 weeks including content audit, design, development, testing, and SEO verification. Rushed migrations risk losing SEO rankings and breaking critical features like online ordering or bookings."
  - question: "Will I lose my Google rankings if I redesign my WordPress website?"
    answer: "Not if you follow proper SEO migration practices. The key is implementing 301 redirects for all existing URLs, preserving meta data, and maintaining content quality. Done correctly, many sites see ranking improvements due to better performance."
  - question: "What's wrong with keeping my WordPress café website?"
    answer: "Nothing inherently wrong, but WordPress sites often suffer from slow load times (4-6+ seconds), security vulnerabilities, plugin conflicts, and ongoing maintenance costs. Modern alternatives like Astro deliver sub-1-second load times with minimal maintenance."
  - question: "How much does a WordPress migration cost for Perth hospitality businesses?"
    answer: "Migration costs vary from $2,000-$8,000+ depending on site complexity, content volume, and custom features needed. However, reduced maintenance costs and improved conversions typically deliver positive ROI within 12 months."
  - question: "Should I migrate my café's online ordering system when redesigning?"
    answer: "Evaluate your current system first. If using a third-party like Square or Gloria Food, these integrate with any platform. WordPress booking plugins may need replacement with equivalent or better solutions on your new platform."
  - question: "Can I keep my domain name when migrating from WordPress?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Your domain name stays the same—only the website hosting and platform changes. Proper DNS configuration ensures zero downtime during the switch."
  - question: "What happens to my blog posts when migrating from WordPress?"
    answer: "All blog content can be migrated to your new platform. The key is preserving URLs and meta data. MDX format often provides better performance and editing experience than WordPress's block editor."
  - question: "How do I know if my current WordPress site needs replacing?"
    answer: "Key warning signs include: load times over 3 seconds, frequent security issues, broken plugins, mobile display problems, difficulty updating content, and poor Core Web Vitals scores. If you're experiencing multiple issues, migration makes sense."

If your Perth café is still running on a WordPress website built years ago, you're not alone. Many hospitality businesses launched on WordPress because it was accessible and affordable. But times have changed, and that ageing WordPress site may now be hurting your business more than helping it.

This guide provides a complete checklist for migrating your café website from WordPress to a modern platform—whether that's Astro, Next.js, or another high-performance solution. We'll ensure you preserve SEO rankings, maintain functionality, and create a website that actually converts visitors to guests.

## Why Perth Cafés Are Leaving WordPress

WordPress powers about 40% of websites globally, but it's increasingly becoming a liability for hospitality businesses. Here's what we see with Perth café WordPress sites:

| Common WordPress Issue | Business Impact |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 4-6 second load times | 53% of mobile users abandon slow sites |
| Security vulnerabilities | Constant plugin updates or risk of hacking |
| Plugin conflicts | Features break after updates |
| Poor mobile experience | Frustrates 70%+ of visitors on phones |
| High maintenance costs | $50-200+/month for hosting, security, updates |
| Dated design | Looks unprofessional compared to competitors |

The hospitality industry demands fast, mobile-first websites. Your menu needs to load instantly. Your booking system can't glitch. Your photos must display beautifully on every device.

Modern static site generators and headless CMS solutions deliver [dramatically better performance](/blog/astro-vs-wordpress-hospitality-websites-perth/) without the maintenance headaches.

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Audit (Week 1-2)

Before touching any code, you need a comprehensive audit of your existing WordPress site.

### Content Inventory

Create a spreadsheet documenting:

**Every page on your site:**
- Home page
- Menu page(s)
- About/Story page
- Contact page
- Gallery/Portfolio
- Blog posts
- Location pages
- Special event pages
- Private dining or catering pages
- Any landing pages

**For each page, record:**
- Current URL
- Page title
- Meta description
- Primary keywords
- Word count
- Images used
- Last updated date

This inventory prevents content from falling through the cracks during migration.

### Functionality Audit

List every functional element that must work on the new site:

- [ ] Contact form (where do submissions go?)
- [ ] Online booking/reservation system (which provider?)
- [ ] Online ordering (Square, Gloria Food, direct orders?)
- [ ] Newsletter signup (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.)
- [ ] Gift card purchases
- [ ] Social media feeds/embeds
- [ ] Google Maps integration
- [ ] Menu PDF downloads
- [ ] Image galleries/lightboxes
- [ ] Video embeds
- [ ] Loyalty program integration
- [ ] Third-party review widgets

### Technical Audit

Gather baseline metrics for comparison:

**Performance:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights scores (mobile and desktop)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Average page load time

**SEO:**
- Current Google ranking positions for key terms
- Organic traffic levels (last 12 months)
- Backlink profile (Ahrefs, Moz, or Search Console)
- Indexed pages count

**Security:**
- SSL certificate status
- Security plugin configuration
- Known vulnerabilities

### WordPress-Specific Inventory

Document your WordPress setup:

**Theme:**
- Theme name and version
- Child theme modifications
- Custom CSS additions

**Plugins (export full list):**
- Essential plugins for functionality
- SEO plugins and their settings
- Caching and performance plugins
- Security plugins
- Backup plugins
- Any premium plugins with licenses

**Database:**
- Export WordPress database backup
- Document custom post types
- Note any ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) configurations

## Phase 2: Platform Selection (Week 2-3)

Choose your new platform based on your café's specific needs:

### Static Site Generators (Recommended for Most Cafés)

| Platform | Best For | Load Time | Learning Curve |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Astro** | Content-focused sites, blogs, menus | Sub-1 second | Moderate |
| **Next.js** | Complex features, booking integration | Under 2 seconds | Steeper |
| **Eleventy** | Simple sites, minimal JavaScript | Sub-1 second | Moderate |

**Why we recommend Astro for Perth hospitality:** It delivers exceptional performance, supports modern content formats, and integrates seamlessly with headless CMS options. Our own site runs on Astro.

### Headless CMS Options

For clients who need easy content editing:

| CMS | Best For | Pricing |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Sanity | Complex content, real-time preview | Generous free tier |
| Contentful | Enterprise needs, API-first | Free tier limited |
| Storyblok | Visual editing, intuitive UI | From €9/month |
| Decap CMS | Git-based, no database | Free |

### E-commerce/Ordering Integration

| Platform | Ordering Capability | Best For |
|----------|--------------------| ---------|
| Square Online | Full POS integration | Already using Square |
| Gloria Food | Zero-commission orders | Budget-conscious |
| Toast | Full restaurant management | High-volume venues |
| Custom solution | Complete control | Unique requirements |

## Phase 3: SEO Preservation Strategy (Critical)

This phase is non-negotiable. Poor SEO migration can destroy years of ranking progress.

### URL Mapping

Create a mapping document for every URL:

```
Old URL                           → New URL                          → Redirect Type
/menu/                            → /menu/                           → None (same)
/our-story/                       → /about/                          → 301
/news/new-summer-menu/            → /blog/new-summer-menu/           → 301
/wp-content/uploads/menu-2024.pdf → /docs/menu-2024.pdf              → 301
```

**Rules for URL decisions:**
1. Keep high-performing URLs identical when possible
2. Simplify overly complex WordPress URLs
3. Remove date-based blog URLs if not needed
4. Create 301 redirects for any URL changes
5. Never use 302 (temporary) redirects

### Meta Data Migration

Transfer all SEO elements:

- [ ] Page titles
- [ ] Meta descriptions
- [ ] Open Graph data (og:title, og:description, og:image)
- [ ] Twitter Card data
- [ ] Canonical URLs
- [ ] Schema markup (LocalBusiness, Restaurant, Menu)

If using Yoast or Rank Math, export their settings for reference.

### Content Quality Check

Migration is an opportunity to improve content:

- Update outdated information
- Improve thin content pages
- Consolidate similar pages
- Add internal links where missing
- Refresh [food photography](/perth-food-photography/) to current standards
- Update staff photos and bios

### Sitemap and Robots.txt

- Generate new XML sitemap
- Verify robots.txt allows indexing
- Submit new sitemap to Google Search Console post-launch

## Phase 4: Design and Development (Week 3-6)

With planning complete, development begins.

## Phase 5: Content Migration (Week 4-6)

Systematically transfer and improve content.

### Page Migration Process

For each page:

1. **Copy content** from WordPress (use your inventory)
2. **Clean formatting** (remove WordPress cruft)
3. **Optimise images** (convert to WebP, resize appropriately)
4. **Verify internal links** point to new URLs
5. **Add schema markup** where relevant
6. **Test on mobile** and desktop

### Blog Post Migration

For content-heavy sites:

1. Export posts from WordPress (XML export)
2. Convert to MDX or your chosen format
3. Preserve publish dates and author attribution
4. Maintain categories and tags structure
5. Update any WordPress-specific shortcodes
6. Verify code blocks and embeds work

### Image Migration

WordPress often creates multiple image sizes. For migration:

1. Identify original high-quality images
2. Re-export from originals if available
3. Convert to WebP for better performance
4. Implement responsive image srcsets
5. Write descriptive alt text for accessibility
6. Optimise file sizes (target under 200KB for most images)

### Menu Migration

If using a WordPress menu plugin:

1. Export menu data
2. Verify pricing is current
3. Update dish descriptions
4. Check dietary indicators (V, VG, GF)
5. Ensure menu matches current offerings

## Phase 6: Testing (Week 6-7)

Rigorous testing prevents launch day disasters.

- [ ] Safari (desktop and iOS)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Samsung Internet (common in Australia)

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Run PageSpeed Insights on all key pages
- [ ] Test on throttled 4G connection
- [ ] Verify Core Web Vitals metrics
- [ ] Compare against WordPress baseline

### SEO Verification

## Phase 7: Launch (Week 7-8)

With testing complete, you're ready to launch.

### Pre-Launch Checklist

**48 hours before:**
- [ ] Final content review
- [ ] Backup WordPress site completely
- [ ] Prepare DNS changes
- [ ] Notify booking/ordering providers

**Day of launch:**
- [ ] Update DNS records
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate active
- [ ] Test all critical functionality
- [ ] Monitor for errors

### Post-Launch Actions

**Immediately:**
- [ ] Test all forms with real submissions
- [ ] Verify Google Analytics tracking
- [ ] Submit new sitemap to Search Console
- [ ] Test a real booking/order

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Monitor 404 errors in Search Console

- [ ] Gather team feedback on CMS

### WordPress Decommissioning

Don't delete your WordPress site immediately:

1. **Keep WordPress live** on a subdomain for 30 days
2. **Maintain backups** of database and files
3. **Cancel hosting** only after confirming migration success
4. **Transfer any active plugin licenses** if applicable

## Common Migration Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' errors:

### Mistake 1: Rushing the Timeline

**Problem:** Launching before proper testing leads to broken features and SEO damage.

**Solution:** Build in buffer time. A delayed launch is better than a broken one.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring 301 Redirects

**Problem:** Visitors and search engines hit 404 errors, destroying SEO value.

**Solution:** Map every URL. Test every redirect. Monitor 404s post-launch.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Mobile Testing

**Problem:** Site looks great on desktop but breaks on mobile—where 70%+ of traffic comes from.

**Solution:** Design mobile-first. Test on real devices, not just browser emulators.

### Mistake 4: Losing Backlinks

**Problem:** High-value backlinks to your old site now point to 404 pages.

**Solution:** Identify top backlinks with Ahrefs or Moz. Ensure redirects cover these URLs.

### Mistake 5: Downgrading Content Quality

**Problem:** Migration copy-paste loses formatting, images, and nuance.

**Solution:** Review every migrated page. This is an opportunity to improve, not just replicate.

## Expected Results After Migration

What to expect after a successful WordPress migration:

| Metric | Typical Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|
| Page load time | 60-80% faster |
| PageSpeed score | Often doubles (40 → 80+) |
| Mobile usability | Significant improvement |
| Hosting costs | Often 50%+ reduction |
| Maintenance time | Dramatically reduced |
| Security incidents | Near zero |

**Timeline for SEO recovery:**

- Week 1-2: Rankings may fluctuate (normal)
- Week 3-4: Rankings stabilise
- Month 2-3: Often see improvements due to better performance
- Month 6+: Full benefit of Core Web Vitals improvements
