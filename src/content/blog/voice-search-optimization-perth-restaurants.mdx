faq:
  - question: "How do voice searches differ from typed searches for restaurants?"
    answer: "Voice searches are typically longer and more conversational. Instead of typing 'Italian restaurant Perth', someone might ask 'Hey Google, where's a good Italian restaurant open late in Northbridge?' Voice queries average 5-7 words compared to 2-3 for typed searches."
  - question: "What percentage of searches are now voice-based?"
    answer: "Approximately 27% of the global online population uses voice search on mobile. For local searches like finding restaurants, this percentage is even higher—around 58% of consumers have used voice search to find local business information."
  - question: "How do I optimise my Perth restaurant for 'near me' voice searches?"
    answer: "Ensure your Google Business Profile is complete with accurate address and suburb, maintain consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all directories, target suburb-specific keywords on your website, and build local citations on Australian directories."
  - question: "Do voice assistants use Google Business Profile information?"
    answer: "Yes. Google Assistant pulls directly from your Google Business Profile. Siri uses Apple Maps and Yelp data. Alexa uses Yelp and local data sources. Having a complete, accurate GBP is essential for voice search visibility."
  - question: "What's a featured snippet and why does it matter for voice search?"
    answer: "A featured snippet is the boxed answer that appears at the top of Google search results. Voice assistants often read out the featured snippet as their answer. Structuring your content with clear questions and concise answers increases your chances of winning these snippets."
  - question: "Should Perth restaurants optimise for Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant?"
    answer: "Focus on Google Assistant first—it has the largest market share in Australia and uses Google Business Profile data. Ensure your venue is also listed on Yelp and Apple Maps for Siri and Alexa visibility."
  - question: "How does page speed affect voice search rankings?"
    answer: "Voice search results load 52% faster than average web pages. Google prioritises fast-loading, mobile-friendly pages for voice answers. If your Perth restaurant website is slow, you're less likely to be recommended."
  - question: "Can voice search help my Perth café rank for specific dishes?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Optimise for queries like 'Where can I get the best eggs benedict in Leederville?' by mentioning signature dishes on your website with natural, conversational language and structured data markup."

"Hey Siri, find me a good coffee shop near me."

"Alexa, what restaurants are open late in Northbridge?"

"OK Google, where can I get gluten-free breakfast in Mount Lawley?"

These voice searches are happening right now across Perth. And if your hospitality venue isn't optimised for them, you're missing customers who never even see your name.

Voice search isn't the future anymore—it's the present. Here's how to ensure your Perth restaurant, café, or bar gets found when customers ask.

## Why Voice Search Matters for Perth Hospitality

Voice search is fundamentally changing how people find local businesses:

| Statistic | Implication for Perth Venues |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 58% of consumers have used voice search for local business info | More than half your potential customers might find you by voice |
| 27% of global online population uses voice search on mobile | Over a quarter of mobile users are speaking, not typing |
| 76% of smart speaker users search for local businesses weekly | Home assistant owners are asking about restaurants regularly |
| Voice search results load 52% faster than average | Your website speed directly impacts voice visibility |
| 22% of voice searches are looking for location-based results | Perth's "near me" searches are dominated by voice |

For Perth hospitality specifically, voice search is particularly important because:

- **Tourists** walking around Elizabeth Quay or Fremantle ask their phones for recommendations
- **Locals** in the car ask for "restaurants near me" while driving through suburbs
- **Busy professionals** ask their smart speakers for lunch options near their Perth CBD office
- **Dietary requirements** are often voiced: "restaurants with vegan options in Leederville"

## How Voice Search Differs from Text Search

Understanding the difference is crucial for your SEO strategy:

### Text Search
- Short, keyword-focused: "Italian restaurant Perth"
- Often incomplete sentences
- 2-3 words average
- User sees multiple results and chooses

### Voice Search
- Conversational, natural language: "What's a good Italian restaurant open late in Northbridge?"
- Full questions or commands
- 5-7+ words average
- Voice assistant gives ONE answer (or a short list)

This means you need to optimise for *conversations*, not just keywords.

## Step 1: Master Your Google Business Profile

Voice assistants rely heavily on Google Business Profile data. Google Assistant pulls information directly from your GBP listing.

### Essential Optimisations

**Complete every field:**
- Business name (exactly as on signage)
- Complete address with suburb
- Phone number
- Website URL
- Hours for every day (including public holidays)
- Business description with natural language

**Category selection matters for voice:**
When someone asks "find me a café near me," Google looks at primary categories. Ensure yours is accurate:
- Choose "Café" vs "Restaurant" based on your primary offering
- Add relevant secondary categories

**Enable Q&A:**
Google's Q&A section can appear in voice search answers. Proactively add common questions:
- "Do you take bookings?"
- "Is there parking nearby?"
- "Do you have vegetarian options?"

For a complete setup guide, see our [Google Business Profile optimisation guide](/blog/google-business-profile-setup-perth-restaurants/).

## Step 2: Optimise for Conversational Keywords

Voice searches are questions and commands. Optimise your website content accordingly.

### Question Keywords to Target

| Type | Example Voice Query |
|------|---------------------|
| **Where** | "Where can I get good coffee in Subiaco?" |
| **What** | "What's the best brunch in Fremantle?" |
| **When** | "When does [restaurant] open on Sunday?" |
| **How** | "How do I book a table at [venue]?" |
| **Which** | "Which restaurants in Perth have outdoor seating?" |
| **Is/Does** | "Does [café] have gluten-free options?" |

### Where to Use Conversational Keywords

**Page titles and headings:**
- ✅ "What Makes Our Fremantle Café Special"
- ❌ "About Us - Café Fremantle"

**FAQ pages:**
Structure with actual voice-style questions:
- "What are your opening hours?"
- "Do you take reservations?"
- "Do you cater for dietary requirements?"

**Blog content:**
Write naturally, as if answering a customer's question. Start paragraphs with direct answers.

**Menu descriptions:**
Instead of just "Eggs Benedict - $24", add: "Our signature eggs benedict features free-range eggs from WA farms, house-cured salmon, and freshly baked brioche."

## Step 3: Win Featured Snippets

Featured snippets are the boxed answers at the top of Google results. Voice assistants often read these aloud as THE answer.

### How to Win Snippets

**Structure content for answers:**
- Ask a question in a heading
- Answer directly in the first sentence
- Follow with supporting detail

**Example optimised content:**

```markdown
### How much does brunch cost in Fremantle?

Brunch in Fremantle typically costs $18-35 per person. Coffee averages 
$5-6, and main dishes range from $16 for toast and eggs to $28 for 
premium options like prawn linguine or wagyu steak and eggs.
```

**Use list formats:**
Google loves pulling lists into snippets:
- Numbered steps
- Bullet point lists
- Comparison tables

**Answer common questions concisely:**
Featured snippet answers are typically 40-60 words. Be direct.

## Step 4: Optimise for "Near Me" Searches

"Near me" searches have grown by over 500% in recent years. Voice makes them even more common.

### Local SEO Essentials

**Consistent NAP everywhere:**
Your Name, Address, and Phone must be identical across:
- Google Business Profile
- Website footer
- Social media profiles
- Directory listings

**Suburb-specific content:**
Create content targeting Perth suburbs where your customers come from:
- "Breakfast in Leederville" (if you're located there)
- "Best cafés near Perth CBD"

**Local citations:**
List your venue on Australian directories:
- TrueLocal
- Yellow Pages Australia
- Yelp Australia
- Dimmi / TheFork
- Zomato

For more on citations, see our [local citation building guide](/blog/local-citation-building-perth-hospitality/).

**Build suburb authority:**
If you're in Mount Lawley, your website should mention:
- Beaufort Street (the main strip)
- Nearby landmarks
- Local events and the community

## Step 5: Improve Website Speed

Voice search results come from fast websites. Google's research shows:

- Voice search results load in an average of **4.6 seconds** (52% faster than average)
- Pages that rank for voice are typically highly optimised for Core Web Vitals

### Speed Optimisations for Perth Venues

**Images:**
- Use WebP format with [proper compression](/blog/how-image-compression-impacts-seo-why-photographers-get-it-wrong/)
- Specify dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Lazy load images below the fold

**Hosting:**
- Use Australian-based servers or a CDN with Sydney nodes
- Enable caching for static assets

**Code:**
- Minimise JavaScript and CSS
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Use a modern framework like [Astro](/blog/astro-vs-wordpress-hospitality-websites-perth/)

Test your speed at [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and aim for 90+ on mobile.

## Step 6: Implement Structured Data

Schema markup helps search engines understand your content and display rich results.

### Essential Schema for Restaurants

**LocalBusiness / Restaurant schema:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Restaurant",
  "name": "The Local Café",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Beaufort Street",
    "addressLocality": "Mount Lawley",
    "addressRegion": "WA",
    "postalCode": "6050"
  },
  "servesCuisine": ["Australian", "Café"],
  "openingHours": ["Mo-Fr 07:00-15:00", "Sa-Su 08:00-16:00"]
}
```

**FAQPage schema:**
Mark up your FAQ section so questions can appear directly in search results.

**Menu schema:**
Mark up menu items with prices and descriptions for enhanced visibility.

For complete schema implementation, see our [schema markup guide for Perth restaurants](/blog/schema-markup-restaurants-wa-guide/).

## Step 7: Optimise for Each Voice Assistant

Different assistants use different data sources:

### Google Assistant
- **Primary data source:** Google Business Profile
- **Optimisation:** Complete GBP, website structured data, strong local SEO

### Siri (Apple)
- **Primary data source:** Apple Maps, Yelp
- **Optimisation:** Claim your Apple Maps listing, maintain Yelp profile

### Alexa (Amazon)
- **Primary data source:** Yelp, Yext
- **Optimisation:** Yelp profile, local directory listings

### Priority for Perth Venues
Focus on **Google Assistant first**—it has the largest Australian market share. Then ensure your Yelp profile is complete and claimed for Siri/Alexa coverage.

## Voice Search Keyword Examples for Perth Hospitality

Here's a conversion table of text keywords to voice equivalents:

| Text Keyword | Voice Search Equivalent |
|--------------|------------------------|
| "brunch Fremantle" | "Where's a good brunch spot in Fremantle?" |
| "Italian restaurant Perth" | "Find me an Italian restaurant near me in Perth" |
| "café open Sunday Perth" | "What cafés are open on Sunday morning in Perth?" |
| "vegetarian restaurant Northbridge" | "Is there a restaurant with good vegetarian options in Northbridge?" |
| "breakfast Leederville" | "What's the best place for breakfast on Oxford Street?" |
| "late night dining Perth CBD" | "Hey Google, what restaurants are open late in Perth CBD?" |

Target both versions in your content strategy.

## Measuring Voice Search Success

Voice search is harder to track than regular SEO, but here are proxy metrics:

**Google Search Console:**
- Monitor queries with question words (what, where, how, etc.)
- Track "near me" and local suburb queries
- Look for increasing long-tail query traffic

**Google Business Profile Insights:**
- Discovery searches (how people found you)
- Actions taken (calls, directions, website)
- Search query breakdown

**General metrics:**
- Mobile traffic increase
- Time on site improvement (engaged users)
- Contact form submissions and calls

## Common Voice Search Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Mobile Optimisation
Voice searches happen on mobile devices. If your [menu isn't mobile-friendly](/blog/complete-guide-mobile-first-menu-design/), you're losing customers.

### 2. Slow Website
Speed is critical for voice. Test and optimise relentlessly.

### 3. Incomplete Google Business Profile
Missing hours, no photos, wrong category—all hurt your voice visibility.

### 4. Keyword Stuffing Instead of Natural Language
Write like you're talking to a customer, not a search engine.

### 5. Ignoring FAQ Content
Voice searches are often questions. Your site needs answers.

### 6. Poor Local SEO Foundation
Voice relies on strong local signals. [Build your citations](/blog/local-citation-building-perth-hospitality/) and [optimise your GBP](/blog/google-business-profile-setup-perth-restaurants/).
