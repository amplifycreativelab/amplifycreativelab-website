faq:
  - question: "How long does Google Business Profile verification take in Perth?"
    answer: "Most Perth businesses receive their verification postcard within 5-14 days. Video verification (where available) can be instant. Phone verification is sometimes offered for established businesses."
  - question: "Can I have multiple Google Business Profiles for my Perth restaurant?"
    answer: "You should only have one profile per physical location. If you operate multiple venues (e.g., cafes in Leederville and Fremantle), each needs its own profile with a unique address."
  - question: "What's the best primary category for a Perth café vs restaurant?"
    answer: "Use 'Café' as your primary category if coffee and daytime service are your focus. Use 'Restaurant' if you offer full sit-down dining. You can add secondary categories like 'Brunch Restaurant' or 'Coffee Shop' for broader visibility."
  - question: "How many photos should I upload to my Google Business Profile?"
    answer: "Aim for at least 10-20 high-quality photos covering your exterior, interior, food, drinks, and team. Businesses with 100+ photos receive 520% more driving direction requests and 1,065% more website clicks according to Google data."
  - question: "Should I respond to every Google review for my Perth restaurant?"
    answer: "Yes. Responding to all reviews—positive and negative—shows potential customers you care about feedback. It also signals activity to Google's algorithm, potentially improving your local ranking."
  - question: "How do I remove a fake Google review for my Perth venue?"
    answer: "Flag the review through your Business Profile dashboard. Provide evidence if possible. Google reviews violating policies (spam, fake, off-topic) can be removed, though the process can take 1-3 weeks."
  - question: "What hours should I set if my Perth café has different weekday and weekend hours?"
    answer: "Google Business Profile allows you to set different hours for each day. Always update for public holidays and special events to avoid frustrated customers arriving when you're closed."
  - question: "Do Google Posts actually help Perth restaurants get more customers?"
    answer: "Yes. Active posting signals a well-maintained business. Posts appear in your Knowledge Panel and can highlight specials, events, or new menu items. They expire after 7 days, so post weekly for best results."

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is arguably the most important free marketing tool for any Perth hospitality venue. When someone searches "best coffee near me" or "restaurants in Fremantle", your GBP listing determines whether you appear—and how appealing you look compared to competitors.

Yet many Perth cafés and restaurants have incomplete, outdated, or poorly optimised profiles. This guide walks you through setting up and optimising your Google Business Profile from scratch, with specific advice for Perth hospitality venues.

## Why Google Business Profile Matters for Perth Hospitality

Before diving into setup, let's understand why this matters:

| Statistic | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 46% of Google searches have local intent | Nearly half of all searches are looking for nearby businesses |
| 76% of local mobile searches result in a store visit within 24 hours | Local visibility directly drives foot traffic |
| 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations | Your star rating and reviews are crucial |
| Businesses with complete GBP listings are 70% more likely to attract visits | Incomplete profiles hurt your visibility |

For Perth hospitality specifically, Google Business Profile is often the deciding factor when tourists search "restaurants near Elizabeth Quay" or locals look for "breakfast in Leederville".

## Step 1: Claim or Create Your Profile

### If Your Business Already Exists on Google Maps

Many Perth venues already have a listing created by Google from public data. To claim it:

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Search for your business name and address
3. Click "Claim this business" if it appears
4. Follow the verification process (more on this below)

### If You're a New Business

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Click "Manage now"
3. Enter your exact business name (as it appears on your signage)
4. Select your business category
5. Enter your full address
6. Add phone number and website

**Perth tip:** Use your actual trading name, not your company registration name. "The Local Café" is better than "Perth Hospitality Pty Ltd".

## Step 2: Verification Process

Google needs to verify you actually own or manage the business. For Perth venues, the most common methods are:

### Postcard Verification (Most Common)
- Google mails a postcard with a verification code to your business address
- Takes 5-14 days in Perth metro
- Don't change any profile details while waiting—it can restart the process

### Phone Verification (Sometimes Available)
- Automated call or SMS to your business phone
- Only offered to some established businesses
- Instant verification if available

### Video Verification (Newer Option)
- Record a video showing your storefront, signage, and interior
- Can be completed same-day
- Available for select business types

**Important:** If you're opening a new venue, start the verification process 2-3 weeks before your launch to ensure your profile is live on day one.

## Step 3: Optimise Your Business Information

Once verified, complete every possible field. Google rewards complete profiles with better visibility.

### Business Name
Use your exact trading name. Don't stuff keywords like "Best Coffee Perth CBD" into your name—this violates Google's guidelines and can get your listing suspended.

✅ **Do:** "The Beaufort Street Café"
❌ **Don't:** "The Beaufort Street Café - Best Breakfast Mount Lawley Perth"

### Categories

Your primary category is crucial. Choose the most specific option that describes your main offering:

| If You Are... | Primary Category | Secondary Categories |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Full-service restaurant | Restaurant | Fine Dining Restaurant, Italian Restaurant, etc. |
| Coffee-focused café | Café | Coffee Shop, Brunch Restaurant |
| Bar with food | Bar | Cocktail Bar, Wine Bar, Restaurant |
| Takeaway-only | Takeaway Restaurant | Fast Food Restaurant, specific cuisine |
| Food truck | Food Truck | Specific cuisine type |

You can add up to 9 secondary categories. For a Perth café, you might add:
- Brunch Restaurant
- Coffee Shop
- Breakfast Restaurant

### Address and Service Area

Enter your complete street address. If you serve a wider area (catering, delivery), you can also set a service area radius.

For Perth venues:
- Include your suburb (e.g., "123 Oxford Street, Leederville WA 6007")
- Ensure consistency with your website and other listings

### Hours of Operation

Set accurate hours for each day. Perth-specific considerations:

- **Public Holidays:** Update for WA Day, Australia Day, Christmas, etc.
- **Seasonal Changes:** Some Perth venues have different summer/winter hours
- **Special Hours:** Add temporary hours for events like Fringe Festival or Christmas trading

### Phone and Website

- Use a trackable phone number if possible
- Link directly to your homepage or a dedicated menu/booking page
- Ensure your website is mobile-friendly (Google checks this)

## Step 4: Upload Quality Photos

Photos are arguably the most important element for hospitality venues. Google data shows:

- Businesses with photos receive **42% more requests for driving directions**
- Businesses with 100+ photos receive **520% more direction requests** and **1,065% more website clicks**

### What to Photograph

For Perth restaurants and cafés, upload photos in these categories:

**Exterior (3-5 photos)**
- Main entrance during day
- Signage clearly visible
- Street view showing location context
- Outdoor seating if applicable

**Interior (5-10 photos)**
- Full venue shots from multiple angles
- Bar area
- Feature walls or design elements
- Seating areas

**Food & Drinks (10-20+ photos)**
- Hero dishes photographed professionally
- Coffee and beverages
- Seasonal specials
- Desserts and treats

**Team (2-5 photos)**
- Staff in action
- Chef in kitchen
- Candid service moments

### Photo Quality Tips

- Use [professional food photography](/perth-food-photography/) whenever possible—phone snaps hurt your brand
- Minimum 720 x 720 pixels (aim for 1200+ for quality)
- Good lighting—[natural light works beautifully for Perth venues](/blog/natural-light-vs-artificial-light-perth-cafes/)
- No text overlays or watermarks on primary photos

**Pro tip:** Regularly upload new photos (monthly is ideal). This shows Google your business is active and gives you seasonal content opportunities.

## Step 5: Write Your Business Description

You get 750 characters to describe your business. Use them wisely:

**Include:**
- What you offer (cuisine type, specialties)
- Location context (suburb, nearby landmarks)
- Unique selling points
- Call to action

**Example for a Perth café:**

> "The Local Café is a specialty coffee roaster and all-day brunch destination in the heart of Mount Lawley. We source single-origin beans directly from farms and roast in-house weekly. Our seasonal menu features locally-sourced WA produce with vegetarian and gluten-free options available. Join us for breakfast from 7am or grab your morning espresso on Beaufort Street. Book online or walk in."

**Avoid:**
- Keyword stuffing
- Promotional language ("BEST COFFEE IN PERTH!!!")
- Pricing information (use Products/Services for that)
- URLs (they won't be clickable)

## Step 6: Add Products and Services

Google allows you to showcase specific offerings:

### For Restaurants
- Add your signature dishes with photos and prices
- Group by category (Mains, Desserts, Drinks)
- Update seasonally

### For Cafés
- Feature coffee options
- Highlight brunch specials
- Show cabinet food

This creates a mini-menu on your profile, helping customers decide before they visit.

## Step 7: Enable Messaging and Booking

### Messaging
Allow customers to message you directly through Google. This is especially useful for:
- Large group enquiries
- Dietary requirement questions
- Event booking requests

Set up quick replies for common questions about parking, dietary options, and opening hours.

### Booking Integration
If you use a booking system (TheFork, Quandoo, ResDiary), connect it to your Google profile. Customers can book directly from search results, reducing friction.

For Perth venues without formal booking systems, the "Call" button often converts better than adding unnecessary booking tools.

## Step 8: Post Regularly

Google Posts appear in your Business Profile and can highlight:

- **Events:** "Live music this Saturday from 7pm"
- **Offers:** "20% off coffee before 8am this week"
- **Updates:** "New winter menu launching Friday"
- **Products:** "Try our new spring cocktail range"

Posts expire after 7 days, so aim for weekly updates. This builds a pattern that shows Google (and customers) your venue is active and thriving.

## Step 9: Manage Reviews

Reviews are critical for Perth hospitality. Here's how to manage them:

### Generating Reviews
- Ask happy customers directly (a simple "Would you mind leaving us a Google review?" works)
- Add your Google review link to receipts and email signatures
- Use table cards or QR codes in-venue
- Read our full guide on [generating reviews ethically](/blog/how-to-generate-more-reviews-for-your-perth-restaurant-ethically/)

### Responding to Reviews
Respond to **every review**, positive and negative:

**Positive review response:**
> "Thanks so much for the lovely feedback, [Name]! We're thrilled you enjoyed the eggs benedict—it's one of our favourites too. Hope to see you again soon at the café!"

**Negative review response:**
> "Hi [Name], thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We're sorry to hear your visit didn't meet expectations, and we'd love the chance to make it right. Please reach out to us directly at [email] so we can discuss further."

Rules for negative reviews:
- Respond within 24-48 hours
- Stay professional—never get defensive
- Take the conversation offline
- Address specific concerns where possible
- Don't offer public discounts (it invites fake reviews)

## Step 10: Track Performance with Insights

Google Business Profile provides valuable data:

- **Search Queries:** How people find you
- **Views:** Profile impressions
- **Actions:** Calls, directions, website clicks
- **Photo Views:** Which images attract attention

Review these monthly to understand:
- Which search terms bring traffic (are you ranking for "breakfast Leederville"?)
- Peak days and times for profile views
- How your photos compare to competitors

## Common Google Business Profile Mistakes

### 1. Inconsistent NAP
Your Name, Address, and Phone number must be identical everywhere online. "123 Oxford Street" vs "123 Oxford St" causes problems. Audit your website, social media, and directory listings.

### 2. Wrong Primary Category
Choosing "Restaurant" when you're primarily a café (or vice versa) hurts your visibility for relevant searches.

### 3. Poor Quality Photos
Low-resolution, poorly lit, or outdated photos make your venue look unprofessional. Invest in [quality food photography](/perth-food-photography/).

### 4. Ignoring Reviews
Not responding to reviews—especially negative ones—signals poor customer service.

### 5. Keyword-Stuffed Business Name
Adding "Best Perth Restaurant" to your name violates guidelines and risks suspension.

### 6. Outdated Information
Wrong hours, old phone numbers, or closed-location listings frustrate customers and hurt rankings.

## Perth-Specific Optimisation Tips

### Suburb Targeting
Perth's suburb-focused search behaviour means you should:
- Mention your suburb in your description
- Include suburb-specific keywords in your products/services
- Consider your positioning for nearby suburb searches too

### Seasonal Adjustments
- Update hours for Perth Festival, Fringe, and major events
- Add summer hours for coastal venues like Scarborough
- Highlight air conditioning or outdoor seating for Perth's climate

### Competition Analysis
Look at top-ranking competitors in your suburb:
- How many photos do they have?
- What categories do they use?
- How do they respond to reviews?

Match or exceed their effort level.

## Next Steps

Your Google Business Profile is a living asset that requires ongoing attention:

1. **Weekly:** Post updates, respond to reviews
2. **Monthly:** Upload new photos, check insights
3. **Quarterly:** Review and update services, hours, description
4. **Annually:** Audit all information for accuracy
