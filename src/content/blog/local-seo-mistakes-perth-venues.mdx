<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mistake #1: Inconsistent NAP</strong> — Name, Address, Phone differences across directories hurt rankings (10% of ranking weight)</li>
    <li><strong>Mistake #2: Neglected Google Business Profile</strong> — Missing photos, posts, Q&A, and attributes reduces visibility</li>
    <li><strong>Mistake #3: No localized content</strong> — Failing to target suburb-specific keywords like "café Mount Lawley"</li>
    <li><strong>Mistake #4: Poor technical SEO</strong> — 40% of users abandon sites taking 3+ seconds to load</li>
    <li><strong>Mistake #5: Ignoring reviews</strong> — Review signals account for ~15% of local-pack ranking factors</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<p>
  <strong>Local SEO is the process of optimizing your online presence to attract more customers from relevant local searches.</strong> For Perth hospitality venues, this means appearing when potential diners search for "best coffee near me," "restaurant in Northbridge," or "café with outdoor seating Fremantle." Yet many venues unknowingly make critical local‑SEO mistakes that push them down in Google's results, sending hungry customers straight to their competitors.
</p>

<p>
  According to a 2024 BrightLocal study, <strong>87% of consumers use Google to evaluate local businesses</strong>, and 76% visit a business within 24 hours of a local search. In Perth's competitive hospitality scene—where new venues open regularly in suburbs like Leederville, Subiaco, and Mount Lawley—ignoring local SEO isn't just a missed opportunity; it's a direct threat to your revenue.
</p>

<h2>Mistake #1: Inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) Across Directories</h2>

<p>
  Google uses consistency as a trust signal. If your venue's name, address, or phone number differs on Google Business Profile, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Facebook, and other directories, Google becomes uncertain about your business's legitimacy. This inconsistency can drop your local‑pack ranking or even cause your listing to be suppressed.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data point:</strong> Moz's Local Search Ranking Factors report found that <strong>NAP consistency accounts for approximately 10% of local‑pack ranking weight</strong>. A single mismatch—like "St." versus "Street" or an old phone number—can be enough to hurt your visibility.
</p>

<h3>How to Fix It</h3>

<p>
  Conduct a NAP audit using free tools like BrightLocal or Moz Local. Update every directory to match exactly what's on your Google Business Profile and website. Pay special attention to older listings you may have forgotten (e.g., TrueLocal, Yellow Pages). Once consistent, monitor regularly to prevent new inconsistencies from creeping in.
</p>

<h2>Mistake #2: Neglecting Google Business Profile Optimization</h2>

<p>
  Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single most important local‑SEO asset for any Perth venue. Yet many venues treat it as a "set‑and‑forget" listing, missing out on features that boost visibility and engagement.
</p>

<p>
  Common GBP shortcomings include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Incomplete business description</strong> that doesn't include local keywords (e.g., "Perth restaurant," "Fremantle café," "family‑friendly dining").</li>
  <li><strong>Missing or low‑quality photos</strong>—Google rewards profiles with fresh, high‑resolution images.</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring the "Posts" feature</strong>, which provides fresh content and can highlight specials, events, or new menu items.</li>
  <li><strong>Leaving the Q&A section empty</strong>, missing a chance to pre‑answer common customer questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Fix It</h3>

<p>
  Treat your GBP as a dynamic marketing channel. Upload new photos monthly, post weekly updates about specials or events, and fill every section with detailed, keyword‑rich information. Use attributes like "outdoor seating," "wheelchair accessible," and "vegetarian options" to capture more specific searches. For a step‑by‑step guide, read our article on <a href="/blog/perth-hospitality-seo-how-to-rank-your-cafe-or-restaurant">Perth hospitality SEO</a>.
</p>

<h2>Mistake #3: Ignoring Localized Content & Keywords</h2>

<p>
  Many Perth venues create generic content that doesn't target the specific suburbs and neighbourhoods where their customers live and search. If your website never mentions "Northbridge," "Leederville," or "Cottesloe," you're missing out on long‑tail local searches that have high conversion intent.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example:</strong> A café in Mount Lawley might rank for "best coffee Mount Lawley" but lose to a competitor that also publishes content like "A Local's Guide to Mount Lawley's Coffee Culture" or "Where to Find Specialty Coffee in Mount Lawley."
</p>

<h3>How to Fix It</h3>

<p>
  Create location‑specific pages or blog posts that naturally incorporate suburb names and local landmarks. Include your target suburbs in title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and body text. If you have multiple locations, build a dedicated page for each. This not only improves your local SEO but also establishes your venue as an authority in that area.
</p>

<h2>Mistake #4: Overlooking Technical SEO for Local Search</h2>

<p>
  Local SEO isn't just about listings and content—your website's technical health directly affects your ability to rank in local results. Slow page speed, poor mobile experience, and missing schema markup can undermine all your other efforts.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data point:</strong> 40% of users abandon a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load. If your menu or booking page is slow, you're losing customers before they even see what you offer.
</p>

<h3>How to Fix It</h3>

<p>
  Run a <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> test to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize images (use WebP format, proper compression), leverage browser caching, and consider a modern framework like Astro for near‑instant loading. Implement local‑business schema markup (<code>LocalBusiness</code>, <code>Restaurant</code>, <code>Menu</code>) to help Google display rich results.

</p>

<h2>Mistake #5: Failing to Generate & Manage Reviews</h2>

<p>
  Reviews are a direct ranking factor for local SEO. Google's algorithm considers the quantity, quality, and recency of reviews when determining local‑pack positions. Venues with few reviews, or with a pattern of negative, unanswered feedback, are penalised in search results.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why it matters:</strong> A Moz survey found that <strong>review signals account for roughly 15% of local‑pack ranking factors</strong>. Moreover, 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.
</p>

<h3>How to Fix It</h3>

<p>
  Proactively ask satisfied customers to leave reviews—ideally on Google, but also on platforms like TripAdvisor and Facebook. Respond to every review (positive and negative) within 48 hours, showing that you value feedback. Never buy fake reviews; Google's detection algorithms are sophisticated, and penalties can be severe.

</p>

<h2>Turning Mistakes into Opportunities</h2>

<p>
  The five mistakes above are common, but they're also fixable. By conducting a thorough local‑SEO audit, you can identify which areas need attention and implement changes that will move the needle within weeks.
</p>

<p>
  Remember: local SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency matters more than perfection. Start with the highest‑impact fixes (like NAP consistency and GBP optimization), then move on to content and technical improvements. Monitor your progress using Google Search Console and Google Analytics to see which changes drive more impressions, clicks, and—ultimately—bookings.
</p>

<h2>Why a Combined Photography & Development Approach Wins</h2>

<p>
  Most local‑SEO guides treat technical optimization and visual content as separate disciplines. In reality, they're deeply interconnected. A fast, well‑coded website that loads stunning professional photos creates a user experience that Google rewards with higher rankings—and that customers reward with more bookings.
</p>
