faq:
  - question: "How do I market to the St Georges Terrace crowd?"
    answer: "Speed and privacy are the currencies of the Terrace. Market an 'Express Executive Lunch' (2 courses in 45 mins) to reassure EAs that their bosses won't be late for 2pm meetings. LinkedIn ads targeted by job title (Partner, Director) in Perth are also highly effective."
  - question: "Is Friday lunch still a 'thing' in Perth CBD?"
    answer: "Yes, but it has changed. The 'long lunch' is now often a monthly team bonding event rather than a weekly occurrence. Market 'Team Lunch Packages' specifically for Fridays to capture this group booking revenue."
  - question: "How can I get more corporate catering orders?"
    answer: "Office managers are your target. Create a dedicated 'Corporate Catering' page on your site with effortless online ordering (no PDF forms!). Drop off high-quality sample boxes to reception desks of major firms in your building."
  - question: "What about the 'After Work' crowd?"
    answer: "The '5pm dash' is huge. Optimise for 'happy hour Perth CBD' and 'bars near St Georges Terrace'. Use distinct, highly visible A-frame signage to catch foot traffic heading to the train stations."
  - question: "Should I open for breakfast in the CBD?"
    answer: "Only if you can do it fast. The CBD breakfast crowd is either 'grabbing a coffee on the run' or 'having a serious meeting'. If you have comfortable booths and table service, market the 'Business Breakfast' as a quieter alternative to lunch."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Gatekeepers:</strong> You aren't just marketing to the diner; you are marketing to the Executive Assistant (EA) who books the table. Make their life easy.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed is Luxury:</strong> For lunch, promising a specific timeframe (e.g., "In and out in 50 mins") is a bigger selling point than price.</li>
    <li><strong>Private Dining Rooms (PDR):</strong> Deals are done in private. If you have a PDR, it should be the star of your website navigation.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkedIn Marketing:</strong> Unlike other suburbs, your audience is on LinkedIn during the day. This is an underutilized channel for hospitality.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Maps Accuracy:</strong> The CBD is a maze. Ensure your pin is exact, and give directions like "Located in the foyer of the 108 building".</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

For hospitality venues in the 6000 postcode, the rules of engagement are different. You are operating in a high-density, high-stress environment where your customers are often "on the clock".

Marketing to the corporate sector requires understanding the psychology of the business meal. It is rarely just about nutrition; it is about networking, celebrating, or closing a deal. Your digital presence needs to signal that you understand these stakes.

## The "Executive Assistant" Strategy

A huge portion of high-value booking decisions in the CBD are made by EAs and Office Managers.
- **The Pain Point:** They are terrified of booking a "bad" venue that embarrasses their boss.
- **The Solution:** Your website must look impeccable. High-resolution photography, clear menus (with prices), and a seamless booking widget (like OpenTable or SevenRooms) are non-negotiable.
- **The Tactic:** Create a "For EAs" section on your functions page offering a small voucher for them for every large group booking they make.

## SEO: Dominating the "Business Lunch"

Ranking for "Best lunch Perth CBD" is a war. You need to be smarter.
- **Niche Down:** "Private business lunch Perth", "Quiet restaurants for meetings Perth", "Gluten free corporate catering Perth".
- **Location Modifiers:** "Restaurants near Brookfield Place", "Lunch spots near QV1". Target the specific towers where 5,000+ people work.

## The "Express" Value Proposition

Time is money on St Georges Terrace.
- **The Offer:** Create a "Power Lunch" menu. "2 Courses, 1 Glass of Wine, 45 Minutes, $55".
- **The Digital Angle:** Promote this fiercely on Instagram Stories at 10:30 AM, just as the "where shall we go for lunch?" conversation starts in offices.

## Photography: Selling Relationships

Your imagery needs to mirror your clientele.
- **Avoid:** Empty, sterile shots.
- **Include:** Photos of groups in suits (models or friends) toasting, shaking hands, or deep in conversation.
- **Lighting:** CBD venues often lack natural light. Ensure your photographer knows how to light interiors to look warm and expensive, not cave-like.

## Happy Hour & The "End of Week" Crowds

Thursday and Friday evenings are peak times.
- **Google Posts:** Update your Google My Business profile every Thursday morning with your drink specials.
- **Geo-Fencing:** Start running ads at 4:00 PM targeted to people within 500m of your venue. "Tough week? awesome cocktails are 5 mins walk away."

## Private Dining: The High-Ticket Item

If you have a separate room, flaunt it.
- **Content:** Write a blog post "Best Private Dining Rooms for Board Dinners in Perth". (Yes, write about yourself).
- **Details:** List the capacity, AV capabilities (is there a screen for presentations?), and set menu options clearly.

## Summary

In the Perth CBD, you aren't just feeding people; you are facilitating their business. Value their time, respect their need for privacy/quality, and make the booking process invisible. Do this, and you become the "company canteen" for the biggest firms in town.
