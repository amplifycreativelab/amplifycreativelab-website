faq:
  - question: "Won't I lose customers if I push them away from UberEats?"
    answer: "You're not pushing customers away from ordering—you're giving them a better option. Customers who already know your brand and want YOUR food are choosing between channels. You're simply making your channel more attractive. Meanwhile, UberEats continues bringing you new discovery customers."
  - question: "What discount should I offer for direct ordering?"
    answer: "A 10-15% discount still makes you more money than a 30% commission. You can offer 10% off, free delivery, a loyalty reward, or a free add-on (drink, side). The key is making the incentive visible and valuable without cutting too deep into margin."
  - question: "How long until I see commission savings?"
    answer: "Most venues see measurable shift within 4-6 weeks of launching a properly promoted direct ordering channel with professional photography. The full impact compounds over months as repeat customers migrate."
  - question: "Can I use UberEats' free photography on my own website?"
    answer: "No—if UberEats provides free photography, they typically own those images and you cannot use them elsewhere. This is another reason to invest in your own professional photography that you own outright and can use anywhere."
  - question: "What if I don't have delivery drivers?"
    answer: "You can offer pickup-only direct ordering, or use third-party delivery-only services like DoorDash Drive, Uber Direct, or Sherpa that provide drivers for a per-order fee (typically 15-20%—still better than full platform commission). Some restaurants mix pickup (commission-free) and delivery (reduced commission)."
  - question: "How much should I spend on food photography for direct ordering?"
    answer: "A half-day shoot covering 10-15 dishes typically costs $800-$1,500 with a professional Perth food photographer. At 30% commission on even $5,000/month in shifted orders, you'd save $1,500/month—paying back the photography investment in under 30 days."
  - question: "Should I still use UberEats if I have direct ordering?"
    answer: "Yes—UberEats serves a different purpose. Use platforms for <strong>customer acquisition</strong> (new customers discovering you), then convert those customers to direct ordering for repeat business. UberEats is your marketing expense; direct ordering is your profit channel."

<h2>The Commission Problem Every Perth Restaurant Faces</h2>

<p>
  Third-party delivery platforms have become a lifeline for many Perth restaurants, cafés, and bars. During lockdowns, they kept venues alive. Today, they're a significant revenue channel. But they come at a steep price.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>UberEats, Menulog, DoorDash, and Deliveroo typically take 25–35% of each order as commission</strong>, plus additional service fees. On a $40 order, that's $10–$14 gone before you've covered food costs, labour, packaging, and overhead. On razor-thin hospitality margins, that's often the difference between profit and loss on every delivery order.
</p>

<p>
  Let's put it in perspective:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Monthly Delivery Sales</th>
      <th>Commission (30%)</th>
      <th>Annual Commission Paid</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$5,000</td>
      <td>$1,500/month</td>
      <td><strong>$18,000/year</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$10,000</td>
      <td>$3,000/month</td>
      <td><strong>$36,000/year</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$20,000</td>
      <td>$6,000/month</td>
      <td><strong>$72,000/year</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  That's $18,000 to $72,000+ per year in commission—money that could be profit, reinvestment, or staff wages.
</p>

<p>
  The alternative—<strong>direct ordering through your own website</strong>—lets you keep the full revenue minus only payment gateway fees (typically 1.5–3%). Yet most Perth venues struggle to move customers away from the convenience of apps they already have installed.
</p>

<p>
  The key to shifting that behaviour isn't just a functional ordering system; it's <strong>visual persuasion</strong>. Customers choose what looks best. If your UberEats thumbnail is more appealing than your website photo, you're handing over 30% of your revenue unnecessarily.
</p>

<h2>The Visual Gap: Why UberEats Often Wins</h2>

<p>
  UberEats invests heavily in optimising its platform for visual appeal. It enforces consistent image dimensions, encourages high-quality thumbnails, and even offers free photography to some partners. Their platform is designed to make food look irresistible—because that's how they generate orders (and commissions).
</p>

<p>
  As a result, your dishes can look more enticing on UberEats than on your own site—especially if your website photos are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outdated (from when you opened)</li>
  <li>Poorly lit (dim or yellow-tinted)</li>
  <li>Shot on a smartphone (lacking depth and professional quality)</li>
  <li>Inconsistent (different styles, angles, or quality across dishes)</li>
  <li>Low resolution (pixelated on modern screens)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This creates a perverse incentive: customers see a beautiful photo on UberEats, tap to order, and you pay a hefty commission. If your own website presented the same dish with equal or better visual impact, many of those customers would happily order directly—especially if you offer an incentive like free delivery or a discount.
</p>

<h3>The Customer Decision Journey</h3>

<p>
  Understanding how customers choose between UberEats and direct ordering reveals where photography makes the difference:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Customer knows your restaurant (from previous visit, social media, or word of mouth)</li>
  <li><strong>Decision:</strong> They decide to order from you</li>
  <li><strong>Channel choice:</strong> They choose between UberEats app and your website</li>
  <li><strong>Convenience wins</strong> unless your website is (a) easy to find, (b) easy to use, and (c) visually compelling</li>
</ol>

<p>
  At step 3, the customer already wants YOUR food—not your competitor's. The only question is which channel they use. If your website looks worse than your UberEats listing, they'll use the app. If your website looks equal or better, and you give them a reason (discount, loyalty points, faster delivery), they'll order direct.
</p>

<p>
  The table shows that direct ordering wins on every metric except one: <strong>discoverability</strong>. UberEats brings you new customers who are actively searching for food. However, once a customer knows your brand, your goal should be to migrate them to your direct channel—and that's where photography becomes your most powerful tool.
</p>

<h2>How Professional Photography Shifts the Balance</h2>

<p>
  Great food photography does more than make dishes look tasty; it builds trust, communicates quality, and creates an emotional connection that generic platform thumbnails can't match. When you invest in professional photography tailored for your direct ordering site, you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase conversion rates:</strong> High-quality images reduce hesitation and make customers more likely to complete an order. Studies show [professional food photography](/blog/how-to-prepare-your-kitchen-for-a-successful-food-shoot) can increase conversion rates by 25-40%.</li>
  <li><strong>Boost [average order value](/blog/menu-engineering-how-photography-boosts-dish-sales):</strong> Appealing photos of high-margin items (desserts, drinks, sides) encourage add-ons that platforms rarely promote effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve brand perception:</strong> Consistent, professional visuals signal that your venue is credible and cares about the customer experience—both online and in the food they'll receive.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhance SEO:</strong> Optimised images with descriptive alt text help your website rank higher in Google searches for "Perth restaurant delivery" or "[suburb] takeaway" or "order [cuisine] online."</li>
  <li><strong>Enable effective remarketing:</strong> Great photos perform better in Facebook/Instagram ads when retargeting past customers to order again—direct.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Crucially, you can use the same professional photos on UberEats <em>and</em> your website—but on your website, they work for you, not for a platform taking a 30% cut.
</p>

<h2>Case Study: A Northbridge Restaurant That Cut Commission by 50%</h2>

<p>
  <strong>"Spice Alley"</strong> (a hypothetical Northbridge Asian-fusion restaurant) was doing $8,000/month in UberEats sales, paying 30% commission ($2,400/month). Their website had a basic ordering system built into their WordPress site, but it used dim, inconsistent smartphone photos that made the food look unappetising compared to their UberEats listing.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The irony:</strong> They were paying $2,400/month in commission partly because their free UberEats photography looked better than their own website.
</p>

<h3>What We Did</h3>

<p>
  We shot a full menu of professional packshots and lifestyle images, optimised for both UberEats thumbnails (800×800px) and their website's ordering page (various sizes including hero images). We then:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Updated their UberEats listings</strong> with the new photos—resulting in a 20% increase in UberEats orders (not the goal, but a welcome side effect)</li>
  <li><strong>Redesigned their website's ordering interface</strong> around the same images, adding clear "Order Direct & Save 10%" messaging throughout</li>
  <li><strong>Ran a simple Instagram campaign</strong> promoting direct ordering with a first-time discount code, using the new photography</li>
  <li><strong>Added QR codes to packaging</strong> with "Loved it? Order direct next time and save 10%"</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Results After Three Months</h3>

</table>

<p>
  <strong>The result?</strong> Direct ordering grew from $1,000 to $5,000/month while UberEats remained steady at $8,000. Total revenue increased, but more importantly, the <strong>revenue mix shifted</strong> toward the higher-margin channel. Commission as a percentage of total delivery revenue dropped from 27% to 18%.
</p>

<p>
  Annual savings from the shift: <strong>approximately $14,400 in commission avoided</strong>, plus the increased revenue from higher conversion and average order values.

<h3>Photography Best Practices for Delivery</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shoot for thumbnails:</strong> Ensure dishes are recognisable and appetising even at small sizes. Avoid cluttered compositions that become unclear when scaled down.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> Use the same styling, lighting, and editing across all images so customers experience a seamless brand journey from platform to website.</li>
  <li><strong>Highlight your unique selling points:</strong> If you use local ingredients, have a famous chef, or offer sustainable packaging, show it in the photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Show the actual portion:</strong> Customers ordering delivery want to know what they're getting. Realistic portion representation builds trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Include "order direct" cues:</strong> In lifestyle shots, subtly incorporate elements that point to your own brand (e.g., your logo on packaging, branded napkins).</li>
  <li><strong>Optimise for dark mode:</strong> Many delivery apps and phones use dark backgrounds—ensure your images pop against dark as well as light.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Setup: Making Direct Ordering Frictionless</h2>

<p>
  Even the best photography won't help if your ordering process is clunky. Your direct ordering system must be as smooth—or smoother—than UberEats. Key elements include:
</p>

<h3>Essential Features for Direct Ordering</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile-first design:</strong> Over 70% of delivery orders are placed on phones. Your ordering page must load in under 3 seconds, display images clearly, and have a simple checkout that works with thumbs.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated payment gateway:</strong> Use a trusted provider like Stripe, Square, or Tyro for secure, one-click payments. Save card details for repeat customers (with their permission).</li>
  <li><strong>Guest checkout:</strong> Don't force account creation—customers want speed, not forms.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-time availability:</strong> If you're using a third-party delivery service (like DoorDash Drive or Uber Direct), ensure your website reflects accurate delivery times and fees.</li>
  <li><strong>Prominent photography:</strong> Place your best images front and centre, with zoom functionality so customers can see details.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear delivery information:</strong> Display delivery zones, fees, minimum orders, and estimated times clearly—don't make customers guess.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Action Plan: Reduce Commission Costs in 30 Days</h2>

<p>
  Ready to start keeping more of your delivery revenue? Follow this four-week plan:
</p>

<h3>Week 1: Audit</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Compare your current UberEats photos with your website images</li>
  <li>Identify the visual gaps—where does UberEats look better?</li>
  <li>Calculate your current commission spend (monthly delivery sales × 30%)</li>
  <li>Set a target: what percentage of orders do you want to shift direct?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2: Shoot</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Book a professional food photography session that captures your entire delivery menu</li>
  <li>Brief the photographer on both thumbnail requirements (800×800px) and website hero shots</li>
  <li>Include packaging shots if your takeaway presentation is a selling point</li>
  <li>Plan for 8-15 hero dishes with additional grid shots for the full menu</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3: Launch</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Update all platforms with the new photos (UberEats, Menulog, DoorDash, your website)</li>
  <li>Redesign your website's ordering page to highlight the professional imagery</li>
  <li>Add clear "Order Direct & Save X%" messaging throughout</li>
  <li>Create QR codes for packaging that link directly to your ordering page</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 4: Promote</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Run an "Order Direct & Save" campaign on Instagram and Facebook using the new imagery</li>
  <li>Email past customers (if you have their data) with the new ordering option</li>
  <li>Train staff to mention direct ordering to dine-in customers: "Next time you want delivery, order through our website and save 10%"</li>
  <li>Add signage in-venue promoting the direct channel</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By the end of the month, you'll have a visually compelling direct ordering channel that competes head-to-head with UberEats—and you'll start seeing commission savings immediately.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Direct Ordering and Photography</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>Won't I lose customers if I push them away from UberEats?</h3>
  <p>
    You're not pushing customers away from ordering—you're giving them a better option. Customers who already know your brand and want YOUR food are choosing between channels. You're simply making your channel more attractive. Meanwhile, UberEats continues bringing you new discovery customers.
  </p>

  <h3>What discount should I offer for direct ordering?</h3>
  <p>
    A 10-15% discount still makes you more money than a 30% commission. You can offer 10% off, free delivery, a loyalty reward, or a free add-on (drink, side). The key is making the incentive visible and valuable without cutting too deep into margin.
  </p>

  <h3>How long until I see commission savings?</h3>
  <p>
    Most venues see measurable shift within 4-6 weeks of launching a properly promoted direct ordering channel with professional photography. The full impact compounds over months as repeat customers migrate.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I use UberEats' free photography on my own website?</h3>
  <p>
    No—if UberEats provides free photography, they typically own those images and you cannot use them elsewhere. This is another reason to invest in your own professional photography that you own outright and can use anywhere.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I don't have delivery drivers?</h3>
  <p>
    You can offer pickup-only direct ordering, or use third-party delivery-only services like DoorDash Drive, Uber Direct, or Sherpa that provide drivers for a per-order fee (typically 15-20%—still better than full platform commission). Some restaurants mix pickup (commission-free) and delivery (reduced commission).
  </p>

  <h3>How much should I spend on food photography for direct ordering?</h3>

    A half-day shoot covering 10-15 dishes typically costs $800-$1,500 with a professional [Perth food photographer](/blog/natural-light-vs-artificial-light-perth-cafes). At 30% commission on even $5,000/month in shifted orders, you'd save $1,500/month—paying back the photography investment in under 30 days.

  <h3>Should I still use UberEats if I have direct ordering?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes—UberEats serves a different purpose. Use platforms for <strong>customer acquisition</strong> (new customers discovering you), then convert those customers to direct ordering for repeat business. UberEats is your marketing expense; direct ordering is your profit channel.

<h2>Conclusion: Your Photos Are Your Profit Lever</h2>

<p>
  In the battle between UberEats and direct ordering, photography is your secret weapon. Professional, platform-optimised images don't just make food look better—they make your direct channel more attractive, reduce your reliance on third-party platforms, and put thousands of dollars of commission back into your pocket each year.

<p>
  For Perth restaurants, cafés, and bars—whether you're in Northbridge, Fremantle, Subiaco, or Mount Lawley—the equation is simple:

<p>
  <strong>Better photos = Higher direct orders = Lower commission costs = Higher profitability</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The investment in professional photography pays for itself many times over—not just through increased sales, but through the commission savings you'll achieve every month, compounding over years of business.
