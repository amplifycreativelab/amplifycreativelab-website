faq:
  - question: "What is the main purpose of a packshot?"
    answer: "A packshot's primary job is to show the product clearly, accurately, and without distraction. It helps the customer understand exactly what they are buying—colour, shape, packaging details, and scale—minimising returns and building purchase confidence."
  - question: "Do I need props for a packshot?"
    answer: "No. A true packshot uses a plain background (usually white) and no props. The goal is accuracy and clarity. Styled images with props are called 'hero shots' or 'creative product photography'. You need both, but for different purposes."
  - question: "How much does a packshot cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Packshots are typically the most affordable type of professional photography because they are shot in volume with a consistent setup. Prices in Perth usually range from $30–$80 per image depending on volume and complexity (e.g., reflective surfaces or difficult textures)."
  - question: "What file format is best for e-commerce packshots?"
    answer: "JPEG is standard for most platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon) due to its balance of quality and file size. We also provide WebP files for superior web performance. Ideally, images should be square (1:1 aspect ratio) and at least 2000x2000 pixels for zoom functionality."
  - question: "Can I take packshots with my phone?"
    answer: "You can, but lighting is the challenge. Smartphone cameras often distort product shapes (wide-angle lens distortion) and struggle with colour accuracy. For a professional brand, investing in studio-lit packshots ensures your product looks premium and trustworthy."

If you're launching an online store in Perth, you've likely heard the term "packshot" thrown around by photographers, web designers, or marketplaces like Amazon. But what exactly *is* a packshot, and why is it distinct from other types of product photography?

In simple terms: **The packshot is the "money shot" that closes the sale.**

While creative lifestyle images catch attention on Instagram, the humble packshot does the heavy lifting on your product page's "Add to Cart" section. Here is your complete guide to the most essential image in e-commerce.

## What is a Packshot?

A **packshot** (or packaging shot) is a still or moving image of a product, usually including its packaging and labeling, taken against a plain background (typically white or grey).

Its defining characteristics are:
- **Plain Background:** No distractions. Usually pure white (RGB 255,255,255) or transparent.
- **Even Lighting:** Soft, uniform lighting that illuminates the entire product clearly.
- **Accuracy:** True-to-life colours, readable text, and accurate representation of shape and texture.
- **Standard angles:** Front-on, back, and 45-degree views are standard.

Unlike [creative product photography](/blog/skincare-beauty-product-photography-perth), a packshot isn't trying to sell a "feeling" or a lifestyle. It's trying to answer the customer's practical questions: *What does this look like? What are the ingredients? Does the pump look sturdy?*

## Packshot vs. Hero Shot vs. Lifestyle: What's the Difference?

Understanding these distinctions helps you budget your photography spend effectively.

### 1. The Packshot (Informational)
*   **Goal:** Accuracy and information.
*   **Style:** White background, even light, no props.
*   **Use Case:** The main image on your WooCommerce or Shopify product page; Amazon listings; Google Shopping feed.
*   **Cost:** Lower (shot in bulk).

### 2. The Hero Shot (Aspirational)
*   **Goal:** Impact and branding.
*   **Style:** Dramatic lighting, coloured backgrounds, simple props, "floating" effects, or shadows.
*   **Use Case:** Website banners, collection page headers, advertising.
*   **Cost:** Higher (requires creative styling and complex lighting).

### 3. Lifestyle Photography (Contextual)
*   **Goal:** Emotional connection and scale.
*   **Style:** Product in use, human hands/models, real-world environment (e.g., a candle on a bedside table).
*   **Use Case:** Social media (Instagram/Pinterest), email marketing, "in-context" gallery images.
*   **Cost:** High (requires location/models).

## Why Your Perth E-Commerce Store Needs Professional Packshots

It might be tempting to skip the "boring" white background shots and focus on cool lifestyle content. Here is why that's a mistake for your bottom line.

### 1. Trust and Professionalism
A inconsistent product grid—where some items have grey backgrounds, some are yellow-tinted, and some are cropped differently—screams "amateur." Uniform, clean packshots make your brand look established and trustworthy instantly.

### 2. Marketplace Requirements
If you plan to sell on **Amazon Australia**, **The Iconic**, or use **Google Shopping ads**, you *must* have white-background packshots. Amazon strictly rejects primary images that are not on pure white backgrounds.

### 3. Reduced Returns
A significant percentage of e-commerce returns happen because "the product looked different online." Creative lighting can mask colours or textures. A packshot's job is to be brutally honest. If your customer knows exactly what they're getting, they are less likely to return it.

### 4. Speed and Consistency
Packshots are uniform. This makes your category pages easy to scan and faster to load (standardised images compress better). It creates a frictionless browsing experience for your customer.

## Key Elements of a Great Packshot

When we shoot packshots for Perth brands—from skincare to food products—we focus on:

*   **Sharp Focus:** The entire product, front to back, should be crisp. We often use "focus stacking" for smaller items to ensure the label and the bottle shape are both sharp.
*   **Colour Calibration:** We use colour charts to ensure your red lipstick looks exactly the same on screen as it does in the tube.
*   **Alignment:** Every product in your collection should sit on the same baseline and take up the same amount of frame space.
*   **Reflections:** Controlling reflections on glass or plastic so the product looks shiny but the label remains readable.
