faq:
  - question: "What are Core Web Vitals?"
    answer: "They are three specific metrics Google uses to measure user experience: Loading performance (LCP), Interactivity (INP), and Visual Stability (CLS). Since 2021, they are a direct ranking factor for SEO."
  - question: "Do Core Web Vitals affect bookings?"
    answer: "Directly. Deloitte found that a 0.1s improvement in mobile site speed increased conversion rates for travel sites by 10.1%. Slow sites frustrate users, who then switch to fast OTA apps like Booking.com."
  - question: "Why is my LCP score poor?"
    answer: "For hotels, the culprit is usually unoptimised hero images or videos. High-resolution photos of rooms are essential, but they must be compressed (WebP) and lazy-loaded. If your hero video is 20MB, your site will fail."
  - question: "How do I fix CLS (layout shifts)?"
    answer: "CLS happens when booking widgets 'pop in' and push content down. To fix this, reserve fixed space (width/height) for your third-party booking engine so the page layout doesn't jump when it loads."

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed = Revenue:</strong> Slow mobile sites drive users to OTAs (Booking.com/Expedia), costing you 15-20% commission.</li>
    <li><strong>The Big Three:</strong> Know your scores for LCP (Loading), INP (Responsiveness), and CLS (Stability).</li>
    <li><strong>Image Optimisation:</strong> Use WebP format for room galleries. Never upload raw camera files.</li>
    <li><strong>Booking Engines:</strong> Third-party widgets (Little Hotelier, SiteMinder) are major performance killers—implement them carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Ranking:</strong> Passing Core Web Vitals is now a requirement to rank in the Top Stories and organic search results effectively.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

For Perth hotels and accommodation providers, the battle for bookings is fought on two fronts: against competitors down the street, and against the OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) like Booking.com and Expedia.

While OTAs charge 15-20% commission, they invest millions in website speed. If your direct booking website takes 5 seconds to load on a mobile phone, a potential guest won't wait. They'll bounce back to Google and book via the OTA—costing you margin.

This guide explains **Core Web Vitals** simply and shows how fixing them can increase your direct bookings.

## The Metrics That Matter

Google measures your site against three specific metrics. You can check yours at `pagespeed.web.dev`.

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - "The Loading Speed"
**What it is:** How long it takes for the main content (usually your hero image) to appear.
**Target:** Under 2.5 seconds.
**Common Hotel Fail:** Uploading a 10MB uncompressed image of the pool as the background.
**The Fix:** Resize images to screen resolution, convert to WebP, and use a CDN.

### 2. Interaction to Next Paint (INP) - "The Responsiveness"
**What it is:** How quickly the site reacts when a user taps "Book Now" or opens the menu.
**Target:** Under 200 milliseconds.
**Common Hotel Fail:** Heavy JavaScript from chat widgets, weather plugins, and unoptimised booking calendars clogging the main thread.
**The Fix:** Remove unused plugins; defer non-essential scripts.

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - "The Stability"
**What it is:** Does the page jump around while loading?
**Target:** Under 0.1.
**Common Hotel Fail:** The page loads, the user goes to click "Rooms", and suddenly the Booking Widget loads at the top, pushing the button down. The user misclicks.
**The Fix:** Define set dimensions (CSS aspect-ratio) for all image and widget containers.

## The OTA Trap

OTAs like Booking.com have engineering teams dedicated to passing these metrics. Their pages load instantly.
If you area a boutique hotel in Fremantle or a resort in Scarborough, your website is your Digital Front Desk. A slow website is like making a guest wait 10 minutes to check in—they start their experience annoyed.

## Case Study: Optimising a Booking Engine

We worked with a WA accommodation provider using a popular third-party booking engine.
*   **Problem:** The widget added 3 seconds to load time and caused massive layout shifts.
*   **Solution:** We built a custom "Facade" button. The heavy booking script only loaded *after* the user interacted with the "Check Availability" button, not on initial page load.
*   **Result:** LCP dropped from 4.2s to 1.1s. Direct mobile bookings increased by 18%.

## How We Build High-Performance Hotel Sites

At Amplify, we specialise in **Headless Architecture** for hospitality.
This means we build the frontend of your site using ultra-fast technology (Astro), while keeping your preferred CMS (WordPress) or Booking Engine (SiteMinder) in the background.

You get the ease of management you're used to, with the speed of an OTA.

## Action Plan for Hotel Managers

1.  **Audit:** Run your site through PageSpeed Insights today.
2.  **Compress:** Ask your web team if images are being served in Next-Gen formats (WebP/AVIF).
3.  **Evaluate:** Are plugins (Chatbots, Popups) worth the speed penalty?
4.  **Upgrade:** If your site is on a generic $50 theme, it's likely bloated code. Consider a custom performant build.
