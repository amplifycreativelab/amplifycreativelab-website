faq:
  - question: "Is it illegal to 'spy' on my competitors?"
    answer: "Absolutely not. Market research is a standard business practice. As long as you are gathering publicly available information (visiting as a customer, reading online reviews, checking prices), it is completely ethical and legal. Just don't trespass or steal intellectual property."
  - question: "How often should I look at what competitors are doing?"
    answer: "A deep dive should happen once or twice a year, especially before you update your menu or prices. However, you should lightly monitor their social media and Google reviews monthly to spot new trends or service issues you can capitalise on."
  - question: "Should I lower my prices if my competitor is cheaper?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. If your coffee is better, your service faster, or your atmosphere more premium, you can and should charge more. Competing solely on price is a 'race to the bottom' that hurts everyone's margins. Compete on value instead."
  - question: "What if my competitor is copying ME?"
    answer: "Take it as a compliment, but keep moving. Using a competitor analysis helps you stay ahead. If they copy your Acai bowl, launch a new Protein Waffle they haven't seen yet. Innovation is the only long-term defence against copycats."
  - question: "How do I find out my competitor's engagement rates?"
    answer: "You can calculate this manually (likes + comments / follower count * 100) on their last 10 posts, or use free online tools. High follower counts with low engagement often means they bought followers or have lost relevance."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't copy, contrast:</strong> The goal is to find what they <em>aren't</em> doing, and do that.</li>
    <li><strong>The 'Digital Doorway' is key:</strong> Often customers choose you based on your Google Profile before they ever taste your coffee.</li>
    <li><strong>Reviews are goldmines:</strong> Read your competitors' 1-star reviews to see what frustrates their customers, then solve that problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct vs Indirect:</strong> Your competition isn't just the cafe next door; it's the bakery, the juice van, and the servo coffee.</li>
    <li><strong>Service speed wins:</strong> In Perth's morning rush, efficiency is often a bigger differentiator than bean blend.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Perth has one of the most sophisticated coffee cultures in the world. Walk down any strip in Leederville, Mt Lawley, or Freo, and you're shoulder-to-shoulder with excellent baristas and smashed avo options.

In such a saturated market, "good coffee" is no longer a unique selling point—it's the bare minimum entry requirement. To thrive, you need to understand exactly where you fit in the ecosystem. This isn't about obsessing over others; it's about strategic positioning.

## Step 1: Identify Your *True* Competitors

Not every place selling caffeine is your rival. Categorise them:

### Direct Competitors
Establishments with a similar concept, price point, and target audience within a walking/driving radius.
*   *Example:* You run a specialty brunch spot; the trendy cafe three doors down is a direct competitor.

### Indirect Competitors
Places that solve the same problem (hunger/caffeine need) but in a different way.
*   *Example:* The local bakery (cheaper/faster), the juice bar (healthier), or even the McDonalds McCafe (convenience/drive-thru).

## Step 2: The 'Digital Doorway' Audit

Most customers will judge you against your competitors online before they visit. Compare your digital footprint:

### Google Business Profile
Look at the top 3 competitors in your suburb.
*   **Review Count:** Do they have 50 or 500?
*   **Rating:** Is there a gap? A 4.8 vs a 4.2 is massive.
*   **Photos:** Are their menu photos professional or dark user-generated shots?
*   **Response Rate:** Do they reply to reviews?

### Social Media Presence
*   **Consistency:** Are they posting daily or monthly?
*   **Content:** Is it just coffee art, or do they show people/lifestyle?
*   **Engagement:** Do locals comment and tag friends?

**The Opportunity:** If their photos are old and they ignore reviews, you can win simply by being active, responsive, and visually appealing.

## Step 3: Menu & Pricing Gap Analysis

You don't need to be cheaper, but your pricing must make sense relative to the market.

**Create a simple spreadsheet:**
*   Flat White (Regular) Price
*   Smashed Avo (Standard) Price
*   Vegan Options Count
*   Kids Menu Availability

**Look for the 'White Space':**
*   *Scenario:* Everyone in the area serves a heavy, egg-focused brunch.
*   *Opportunity:* Launch a lighter, health-focused "Superfood" menu section.
*   *Scenario:* No one opens before 7:00 AM.
*   *Opportunity:* Open at 6:00 AM to capture the tradie and gym crowd.

## Step 4: The 'Mystery Shopper' Experience

Go in as a customer (or send a friend). Pay attention to the intangibles:
*   **Greeting:** Was it instant or did you wait?
*   **Speed:** Time from order to table.
*   **Vibe:** Music volume, seating comfort, temperature.
*   **Wifi/Power:** crucial if you want to attract the 'work from cafe' crowd.

## Step 5: Read Their Complaints

This is your secret weapon. Go to their 1-star and 2-star reviews on Google.

**Common Complaints to Look For:**
*   "Coffee was cold." -> **Your Strategy:** Implement rigorous temp checks.
*   "Too noisy/crowded." -> **Your Strategy:** Install acoustic panels and market a "relaxed" vibe.
*   "Not kid-friendly." -> **Your Strategy:** Add high chairs and a colouring station.

You are literally building your business model on their failures.

## Actionable Strategy: The 'Only' Statement

After this analysis, complete this sentence:

*"We are the **only** cafe in [Suburb Name] that..."*

*   ...roasts our own beans on-site.
*   ...has a dedicated secure play area for toddlers.
*   ...offers a full keto-friendly menu.
*   ...delivers coffee to local offices.

If you can't finish that sentence, you are vulnerable. Using this competitor analysis helps you find your "Only."
