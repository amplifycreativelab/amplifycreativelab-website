faq:
  - question: "Why do I need photos of my restaurant interior?"
    answer: "Diners 'eat with their eyes' before they arrive. Interior photos show the atmosphere, lighting, and seating arrangements, helping potential guests visualize their experience and decide if your venue fits their occasion (e.g., romantic date vs. group dinner)."
  - question: "Should I include my staff in the photos?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Human connection is powerful. Photos of your chefs cooking or waitstaff smiling create a sense of hospitality and warmth. It puts a face to the brand and builds trust."
  - question: "What is 'lifestyle' restaurant photography?"
    answer: "Lifestyle photography captures the 'action' of dining—a hand pouring wine, friends laughing over a meal, or a fork taking the first bite. It conveys the feeling of enjoyment rather than just documenting the food."
  - question: "How does this help with booking conversions?"
    answer: "A complete visual story (food + atmosphere + people) reduces uncertainty. When a customer can fully imagine the experience, they are much more likely to click 'Book Now'."
  - question: "Can you photograph during service?"
    answer: "Yes, we can shoot candidly during a quiet service to capture genuine atmosphere. However, for key shots of interiors and hero dishes, we recommend shooting before opening to control lighting and setup."

When most Perth venue owners think of **restaurant photography services**, the first thing that comes to mind is the food. And rightly so—that Wagyu burger or delicate sashimi platter needs to look irresistible.

But in 2025, selling a dining experience is about much more than just the food on the plate. It's about the *lifestyle*, the *vibe*, and the *people*.

At **Amplify Creative Lab**, our restaurant photography services go beyond the dish to capture the soul of your venue.

## The "Vibe Check" is Real

Before a customer books a table in Mt Lawley or Victoria Park, they are doing a digital "vibe check." They are scrolling through your Instagram and Google Maps photos asking themselves:
*   "Is this place fancy or casual?"
*   "Is it loud and energetic or quiet and intimate?"
*   "What do people wear there?"
*   "Does it look comfortable?"

If you only have close-ups of food, you aren't answering these questions. You're leaving money on the table.

## The 3 Pillars of Complete Restaurant Photography

To truly market your restaurant, your image library needs three distinct categories:

### 1. Interiors & Atmosphere
Your fit-out cost a fortune; show it off!
*   **Wide Shots:** Capture the scale of the room, the layout of the tables, and architectural features.
*   **Details:** Close-ups of unique textures, lighting fixtures, table settings, and decor that define your aesthetic.
*   **Lighting:** Capturing the mood—whether it's sun-drenched brunch vibes or moody, candlelit dinner service.

**Why it matters:** It helps customers pick your venue for the right occasion. A corporate group looks for different seating than a couple on a first date.

### 2. The Human Element (Staff & Action)
Hospitality is about people. Sterile photos of empty restaurants can feel cold.
*   **Chef Portraits:** Show the passion and skill in the kitchen. Action shots of flaming pans or delicate plating add drama.
*   **Front of House:** Smiling bartenders shaking cocktails, waitstaff interacting with guests.
*   **The "Pour":** Action shots of wine being poured or coffee being frothed add movement and life to still images.

**Why it matters:** It builds a connection. Regulars love knowing the team, and new guests feel welcomed before they arrive.

### 3. Lifestyle Dining
This is the "social proof" of photography.
*   **The Experience:** Models (or real guests) enjoying the food, laughing, and clinking glasses.
*   **POV Shots:** First-person angles that make the viewer feel like they are sitting at the table.
*   **Hands in Frame:** Adding a human element to food shots (e.g., reaching for a slice of pizza) makes the food look more attainable and delicious.

**Why it matters:** It allows the viewer to project themselves into the scene. "That could be me having fun with my friends."

## Optimizing for Google Maps & Website

These diverse images aren't just for Instagram. They are critical for:
*   **Google Business Profile:** Google favors profiles with a high volume of diverse photos. Interior and exterior shots verify to Google that you are a legitimate, active business.
*   **Website Home Page:** A background video or hero slider showing a busy, happy service is immediately compelling.
*   **Event Packs:** If you host functions, you *need* photos of the space empty and full to sell your packages.
