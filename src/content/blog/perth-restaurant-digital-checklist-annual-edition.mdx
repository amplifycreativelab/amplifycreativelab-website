faq:
  - question: "How often should I run through this checklist?"
    answer: "We recommend a <strong>quick quarterly review</strong> of high‑impact items (like GBP updates and website speed) and a <strong>full annual deep‑dive</strong>. This keeps your digital presence fresh without overwhelming your team."
  - question: "What's the biggest digital mistake Perth restaurants make?"
    answer: "<strong>Neglecting their Google Business Profile.</strong> Many venues create a profile but never update it, leaving outdated hours, missing photos, and unanswered reviews. This directly hurts local search rankings and customer trust."
  - question: "Can I do this checklist myself, or should I hire a professional?"
    answer: "Many items can be handled in‑house with basic technical knowledge. However, tasks like <strong>Core Web Vitals optimization, professional photography, and advanced SEO</strong> often benefit from expert help. If you're short on time or expertise, partnering with an agency that understands both photography and development can ensure nothing falls through the cracks."
  - question: "How much does a professional digital audit cost?"
    answer: "Prices vary depending on depth and website size. A basic audit might start around <strong>$500–$1,000</strong>, while a comprehensive review including photography and technical recommendations can range from <strong>$2,000–$5,000</strong>. The investment typically pays for itself in increased bookings and reduced customer‑acquisition costs."
  - question: "Which section should I prioritise if I can only do one?"
    answer: "<strong>Google Business Profile.</strong> It's free, has immediate impact on local visibility, and takes the least technical expertise. Complete your profile, add fresh photos, respond to reviews, and you'll see results within weeks."
  - question: "How do I know if my website is actually hurting my business?"
    answer: "Check your <strong>bounce rate in Google Analytics</strong>—if it's above 60–70%, visitors are leaving quickly. Run <strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong>—if Core Web Vitals are red, you're losing both rankings and customers. Compare your traffic year-over-year—declining organic traffic signals SEO issues."
  - question: "Should I do this at the same time as my menu refresh?"
    answer: "<strong>Ideally, yes.</strong> Combining your digital audit with a seasonal menu update and photography refresh is efficient—you're already in \"improvement mode\" and can update all assets at once. Many Perth venues do this quarterly to align with seasonal changes."

<p>
  <strong>The Perth Restaurant Digital Checklist is an annual review of every digital touchpoint that affects your venue's online visibility, customer experience, and booking conversions.</strong> It's a systematic way to ensure your website, Google Business Profile, social media, photography, and technical performance are all working together to attract hungry diners and turn them into loyal customers. In Perth's competitive hospitality scene—from Northbridge to Fremantle, Mount Lawley to the CBD—where new venues open monthly and customer expectations rise each year, an annual digital audit isn't just a good idea—it's a business necessity.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data hook:</strong> According to a 2025 Tourism WA survey, <strong>65% of Perth diners say they would avoid a restaurant with an outdated or poorly functioning website</strong>, and <strong>78% of local searches result in a visit within 24 hours</strong>. If your digital presence hasn't been reviewed in the last 12 months, you're likely missing out on hundreds of potential bookings and leaving money on the table.

<h2>1. Website Performance & Core Web Vitals</h2>
<p>
  Your website is your digital front door. If it's slow, hard to navigate, or not mobile‑friendly, customers will bounce before they even see your menu. Google's Core Web Vitals are now direct ranking factors, so performance directly impacts your search visibility.
</p>

<h3>Core Web Vitals Checklist</h3>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong></td>
      <td>Under 2.5 seconds</td>
      <td>Loading performance—when main content loads</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</strong></td>
      <td>Under 200ms</td>
      <td>Responsiveness—how fast page responds to clicks</td>
      <td>PageSpeed Insights</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Mobile-Friendly</strong></td>
      <td>Pass</td>
      <td>Usability on mobile devices</td>
      <td>Google Mobile-Friendly Test</td>

      <td>Active</td>
      <td>Security—encrypted connection</td>
      <td>Browser padlock icon</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Website Performance Actions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds:</strong> Use Google PageSpeed Insights to measure and improve.</li>
  <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under 0.1:</strong> Ensure images and ads have defined dimensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP) under 200 milliseconds:</strong> Optimize JavaScript and remove render‑blocking resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile‑friendly test:</strong> Pass Google's Mobile‑Friendly Test on every key page.</li>
  <li><strong>SSL certificate (HTTPS):</strong> Secure your site; browsers flag non‑HTTPS as "not secure."</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>2. Local SEO & Google Business Profile</h2>
<p>
  When someone searches "restaurant near me" or "Perth café," your Google Business Profile (GBP) is often the first thing they see. An incomplete or outdated GBP can cost you top‑of‑page visibility and direct bookings.
</p>

<h3>Google Business Profile Checklist</h3>

<table>

</p>

<h2>3. Menu & Content Updates</h2>
<p>
  Your menu is the heart of your restaurant's website. It should be easy to read, visually appealing, and optimized for both customers and search engines. An annual review ensures it reflects your current offerings and follows best practices.
</p>

<h3>Menu Audit Checklist</h3>

      <td>Avoid crawl errors</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <li><strong>Replace PDF menus with HTML‑based responsive menus</strong> (see our case against <a href="/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo">PDF menus</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Update prices and seasonal items</strong> promptly—no out‑of‑date specials.</li>
  <li><strong>Add dietary labels</strong> (vegan, gluten‑free, etc.) to capture dietary‑specific searches.</li>
  <li><strong>Include professional photos of signature dishes</strong>—studies show they can increase order values by up to 25%.</li>
  <li><strong>Check for broken links</strong> and outdated content across your entire site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Social Media & Engagement</h2>
<p>
  Social media isn't just about posting pretty pictures; it's about building a community and driving traffic to your website. An annual audit helps you align your social strategy with your business goals.
</p>

<h3>Social Media Audit Checklist</h3>

  <li><strong>Leverage user‑generated content</strong> by reposting customer photos (with permission).</li>
  <li><strong>Track performance metrics</strong> (reach, engagement, click‑throughs) to see what works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Photography & Visual Assets</h2>
<p>
  High‑quality visuals are non‑negotiable in hospitality. They influence everything from menu conversions to social‑media engagement. An annual photo shoot ensures your imagery stays fresh and aligned with current trends.
</p>

<h3>Photography Audit Checklist</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Asset Type</th>
      <th>Review Action</th>
      <th>Update Frequency</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Hero/banner images</strong></td>
      <td>Does it reflect current branding and seasonality?</td>
      <td>Annually (or with major changes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Menu dish photography</strong></td>
      <td>Are all current dishes photographed professionally?</td>

  <li><strong>Optimize all images for the web:</strong> Use WebP format, compress to 80‑85% quality, and include descriptive alt text (e.g., "crispy‑pork‑belly‑northbridge‑restaurant.webp").</li>
  <li><strong>Refresh your hero image</strong> on the homepage to reflect seasonal changes or new branding.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a visual style guide</strong> to maintain consistency across your website, social media, and printed materials.</li>

</p>

<h2>6. Security & Compliance</h2>
<p>
  A secure website protects your customers' data and builds trust. It also helps your SEO—Google prioritizes secure sites. Annual security checks prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or downtime.
</p>

<h3>Security Checklist</h3>

  <li><strong>Scan for malware</strong> using a service like Sucuri or Wordfence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
<p>
  You can't improve what you don't measure. Annual analytics review helps you understand how visitors find and interact with your site, where they drop off, and what drives conversions.
</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together: The Annual Digital Health Check</h2>
<p>
  Treat this checklist as a living document. Schedule a dedicated day each quarter to review one or two sections, and set aside a full day at the end of each year for a comprehensive audit. By staying proactive, you'll not only maintain a competitive edge but also catch small issues before they become costly problems.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, your digital presence is often the first—and sometimes only—impression potential customers have of your restaurant. A polished, fast, and engaging online experience tells diners you care about quality and attention to detail, both on‑screen and on‑plate.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Annual Digital Checklist</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>How often should I run through this checklist?</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend a <strong>quick quarterly review</strong> of high‑impact items (like GBP updates and website speed) and a <strong>full annual deep‑dive</strong>. This keeps your digital presence fresh without overwhelming your team.
  </p>

  <h3>What's the biggest digital mistake Perth restaurants make?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Neglecting their Google Business Profile.</strong> Many venues create a profile but never update it, leaving outdated hours, missing photos, and unanswered reviews. This directly hurts local search rankings and customer trust.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I do this checklist myself, or should I hire a professional?</h3>
  <p>
    Many items can be handled in‑house with basic technical knowledge. However, tasks like <strong>Core Web Vitals optimization, professional photography, and advanced SEO</strong> often benefit from expert help. If you're short on time or expertise, partnering with an agency that understands both photography and development can ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
  </p>

  <h3>How much does a professional digital audit cost?</h3>
  <p>
    Prices vary depending on depth and website size. A basic audit might start around <strong>$500–$1,000</strong>, while a comprehensive review including photography and technical recommendations can range from <strong>$2,000–$5,000</strong>. The investment typically pays for itself in increased bookings and reduced customer‑acquisition costs.
  </p>

  <h3>Which section should I prioritise if I can only do one?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Google Business Profile.</strong> It's free, has immediate impact on local visibility, and takes the least technical expertise. Complete your profile, add fresh photos, respond to reviews, and you'll see results within weeks.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I know if my website is actually hurting my business?</h3>
  <p>
    Check your <strong>bounce rate in Google Analytics</strong>—if it's above 60–70%, visitors are leaving quickly. Run <strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong>—if Core Web Vitals are red, you're losing both rankings and customers. Compare your traffic year-over-year—declining organic traffic signals SEO issues.
  </p>

  <h3>Should I do this at the same time as my menu refresh?</h3>
  <p>
