faq:
  - question: "How does weather affect Scarborough digital marketing?"
    answer: "Massively. Scarborough is a weather-dependent destination. You should have pre-prepared content for sunny days ('Sun's out, taps are pouring') ready to post at 10am to capture the spontaneous beach crowd."
  - question: "What are the best keywords for Scarborough venues?"
    answer: "Focus on 'ocean view restaurants', 'sunset drinks Perth', 'breakfast with a view', and specific location markers like 'near Scarborough Beach Pool'."
  - question: "How do I target tourists in Scarborough?"
    answer: "Optimise your Google Business Profile for 'near me' searches. Tourists use Google Maps heavily to find food after swimming. Ensure your photos show the view—it's your biggest selling point."
  - question: "Should I focus on locals or tourists?"
    answer: "You need both. Tourists fill the summer days, but locals keep you alive in winter. Build an email list to market 'Winter Warmers' and 'Local Specials' to residents when the beach crowd fades."
  - question: "What kind of photography works best for coastal venues?"
    answer: "High-key, bright, and vibrant. Blue skies and golden sunsets should feature heavily. Avoid dark, moody editing unless you are a late-night speakeasy."

Scarborough is more than just a suburb; it’s Perth’s most iconic coastal playground. From the Amphitheatre to the Beach Pool, the redevelopment has turned it into a hospitality hotspot. But for venue owners, the location brings a specific set of challenges: seasonality, intense competition during peak times, and the need to appeal to both bikini-clad tourists and local families.

Marketing a venue in Scarborough requires a strategy that is as dynamic as the weather. It’s about selling the *lifestyle* of the coast, not just the food on the plate.

## The Coastal Vibe: Casual but Premium

Scarborough has moved beyond its old "fish and chips" reputation. The new Scarborough is about "beach club" ripples—relaxed, barefoot, but willing to pay $22 for a cocktail.
*   **Branding Balance:** Your digital identity needs to walk the line between accessible (come in off the beach) and aspirational (stay for a bottle of champagne).
*   **Visual Language:** Use light, airy colours in your web design. Whites, teals, and sands should dominate. Avoid heavy black backgrounds unless you are explicitly a nightclub.

## Seizing the Sunset: The "Golden Hour" Strategy

The sunset is the main event in Scarborough. It is the natural "call to action" for thousands of people every evening.
*   **SEO for Sunsets:** Optimise your website for terms like "**best sunset drinks Perth**", "**ocean view bars Scarborough**", and "**sundowner spots**".
*   **Social Timing:** Post your daily "Golden Hour" special or a photo of the view at 3:00 PM. Catch people while they are deciding where to end their day.

## Weather-Agile Marketing

Scarborough trade fluctuates wildly with the temperature. Your marketing needs to react instantly.
*   **The "Sunny Day" Protocol:** Have a bank of "blue sky" photos and captions ready. If the forecast is good, post them early.
*   **The "Windy Day" Pivot:** Scarborough gets windy. Marketing on these days should focus on your *sheltered* areas. "Escape the sea breeze in our courtyard" or "Warm up inside with a red wine".

## Google Maps: The Tourist Magnet

Tourists staying at the Rendezvous or backpackers leaving the surf don't know the local names. They open Google Maps and type "food".
*   **Proximity Ranking:** Ensure your address is pinned correctly at your entrance, not the back of the building.
*   **"Near Me" Optimisation:** Use attributes like "Takeaway", "Dine-in", and "Casual" to capture broad searches.
*   **Content:** Post photos of your food *with the beach in the background*. It instantly confirms to the user "Yes, we are on the coast".

## Photography: Bright, Blue, and Blissful

Your photography needs to scream "Summer".
*   **Natural Light:** Coastal food looks best in natural daylight. Avoid artificial flash unless it's a stylistic choice for night vibes.
*   **Drone Photography:** Nothing sells a Scarborough venue like a drone shot showing your proximity to the waves. It gives context and scale.
*   **Lifestyle Shots:** Show people! Show groups clinking glasses with the horizon in the background. It provides social proof of the atmosphere.

## Case Study: The "Sunday Session" King

Sunday sessions are a Perth institution, and Scarborough is the capital.
*   **Event Consistency:** Create a recurring Facebook Event for "Sunday Sessions at [Venue Name]".
*   **Live Music Schema:** If you have a DJ or acoustic act, list them on your website with [Event Schema](/blog/schema-markup-restaurants-wa-guide/). It helps you show up when people search "live music Scarborough".

## Winter Proofing Your Brand

The biggest risk in Scarborough is the winter drop-off. You cannot survive on tourists alone in July.
*   **Local SEO:** Target keywords like "**Doubleview local dinner**" or "**Karrinyup family dining**" to attract the inland neighbors.
*   **Email Marketing:** Throughout summer, collect emails for a "Locals Club". When winter hits, use this list to offer "2-for-1 Pasta Nights" or "Warm Up Specials" to keep the locals coming back.

Scarborough offers one of the best backdrops in the world for hospitality. By aligning your digital marketing with the rhythm of the coast, you can turn that view into a reliable revenue stream.
