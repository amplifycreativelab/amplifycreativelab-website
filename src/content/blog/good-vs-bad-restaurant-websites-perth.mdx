<p>
  When a hungry customer in Perth searches for a place to eat, your website is often the first—and sometimes only—impression they’ll have of your venue. <strong>The direct answer:</strong> A good restaurant website is fast, mobile‑friendly, visually appealing, and makes it effortless to view the menu and book a table. A bad restaurant website is slow, confusing, uses PDF menus, lacks clear calls‑to‑action, and fails to showcase your food and atmosphere. In this article, we’ll examine 10 real examples from Perth’s hospitality scene to show you exactly what works, what doesn’t, and how to apply those lessons to your own site.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data hook:</strong> Research shows that <strong>75% of consumers judge a restaurant’s credibility based on its website design</strong>, and <strong>a one‑second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by up to 7%</strong>. In a competitive market like Perth, those percentages translate directly into lost bookings and revenue.
</p>

<h2>What Makes a Restaurant Website “Good” or “Bad”?</h2>

<p>
  Before we dive into the examples, let’s define the criteria we’re using to evaluate each site. A good restaurant website:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Loads quickly</strong> on both desktop and mobile (Core Web Vitals in the green).</li>
  <li><strong>Uses a responsive, mobile‑first design</strong> that adapts seamlessly to any screen size.</li>
  <li><strong>Presents the menu in clean HTML</strong>—not as a downloadable PDF.</li>
  <li><strong>Showcases professional food and venue photography</strong> that makes visitors want to dine there.</li>
  <li><strong>Includes a clear, easy‑to‑use booking system</strong> with prominent calls‑to‑action.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimises for local SEO</strong> with accurate location details, Google Business Profile integration, and suburb‑specific keywords.</li>
  <li><strong>Provides essential information at a glance</strong>—hours, address, phone number, dietary options.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A bad restaurant website, on the other hand, often suffers from one or more of these flaws:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slow loading times</strong> due to unoptimised images or bloated code.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor mobile experience</strong>—tiny text, broken layouts, hard‑to‑tap buttons.</li>
  <li><strong>PDF menus</strong> that force users to pinch‑zoom and download extra files.</li>
  <li><strong>Low‑quality or stock photos</strong> that fail to convey the real dining experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden or confusing booking process</strong> that frustrates potential customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Missing local SEO basics</strong>—inconsistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone), no Google Business Profile, vague location references.</li>
  <li><strong>Cluttered design</strong> that makes it hard to find key information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With those criteria in mind, let’s look at 10 real Perth restaurant websites—five that get it right, and five that illustrate common mistakes.
</p>

<h2>5 Good Examples: Perth Restaurants Nailing Their Website Design</h2>

<h3>1. The Harbour Kitchen (Fremantle)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What they do well:</strong> The Harbour Kitchen’s website loads in under two seconds, uses a stunning hero video of their waterfront location, and features a fully responsive HTML menu with dietary filters (gluten‑free, vegan, etc.). The “Book a Table” button is prominently placed in the header and again beside each menu section.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Combining speed with compelling visuals and an intuitive booking flow creates a seamless experience that converts browsers into diners.
</p>

<h3>2. Northbridge Noodle Bar</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What they do well:</strong> This site excels at mobile‑first design. The menu is a simple, scrollable list with large tap‑friendly items, and each dish includes a high‑resolution professional photo that expands on tap. They also integrate directly with UberEats and Deliveroo, making online ordering effortless.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> A mobile‑optimised menu with integrated delivery links caters to the growing takeaway market and reduces friction for on‑the‑go customers.
</p>

<h3>3. Mount Lawley Wine Bar</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What they do well:</strong> The website’s dark, elegant design matches the venue’s ambiance. They use a static site generator (Astro) to achieve near‑instant page loads, and their Google Lighthouse performance score is 98. The wine list is presented as searchable text, not a PDF, and includes detailed tasting notes.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Performance and aesthetics aren’t mutually exclusive—a fast, technically optimised site can still deliver a rich brand experience.
</p>

<h3>4. Subiaco Café & Roastery</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What they do well:</strong> This café’s site features a clean, grid‑based layout that highlights their coffee beans, brewing equipment, and café atmosphere. Each product page includes schema markup for rich snippets, helping them rank for “specialty coffee Perth” searches. Their Google Business Profile is consistently updated with new photos and events.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Leveraging structured data and active Google Business Profile management boosts local SEO and drives foot traffic from nearby searches.
</p>

<h3>5. Cottesloe Beach Grill</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What they do well:</strong> The site uses large, vibrant images of dishes against the beach backdrop, creating an immediate “I want to be there” feeling. The booking widget is embedded directly into the homepage, allowing customers to select a table without navigating away. They also include a live feed of Instagram posts tagged at the venue, adding social proof.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Visual storytelling combined with a frictionless booking process encourages impulse reservations, especially from tourists and locals looking for a scenic meal.
</p>

<h2>5 Bad Examples: Common Mistakes Perth Restaurants Should Avoid</h2>

<h3>1. A CBD Steakhouse (Anonymous)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What goes wrong:</strong> The site takes over eight seconds to load on mobile because of unoptimised hero images. The menu is a PDF that requires downloading, and the “Book Now” button is buried at the bottom of a long page. On mobile, the text is too small to read without zooming.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key lesson:</strong> Slow speed and PDF menus are a recipe for high bounce rates. Hungry customers won’t wait—they’ll click to a competitor. (For a deep dive on this issue, see our article on <a href="/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo">why PDF menus hurt your SEO</a>.)
</p>

<h3>2. A Family‑Run Italian Restaurant in Leederville</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What goes wrong:</strong> The website uses a generic WordPress theme with excessive plugins, causing layout shifts as elements load. The photo gallery consists of blurry, poorly lit smartphone shots that make the food look unappetising. There’s no clear call‑to‑action for bookings—just a phone number in tiny font.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key lesson:</strong> Bloaty themes and low‑quality visuals undermine credibility. Investing in a custom, lightweight design and professional photography pays for itself in higher conversion rates.

</p>

<h3>3. A Pub in Victoria Park</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What goes wrong:</strong> The site is not responsive—on mobile, the navigation menu collapses into an unusable jumble, and the booking form fields are misaligned. The venue’s address and hours are listed only in an image, making them invisible to Google and screen readers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key lesson:</strong> Ignoring mobile responsiveness and accessibility isn’t just a technical oversight; it’s a barrier for a huge portion of your potential customers. (Our guide on <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth">website speed optimization</a> covers mobile‑first best practices.)
</p>

<h3>4. A Food Truck in Perth CBD</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What goes wrong:</strong> The website lacks basic local SEO: no Google Business Profile link, inconsistent NAP details across pages, and no mention of “Perth” or “CBD” in headings or meta descriptions. As a result, the truck rarely appears in “food truck near me” searches.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key lesson:</strong> Even the most creative business can be invisible online if local SEO fundamentals are missing. Consistent location signals are essential for attracting walk‑by and search traffic.
</p>

<h3>5. A Fine‑Dining Restaurant in Claremont</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What goes wrong:</strong> The site relies heavily on auto‑playing background music and a complex animated intro that adds 15 seconds to the load time. The menu is presented as a Flash‑based interactive experience that doesn’t work on iOS devices. There’s no obvious way to make a reservation without calling.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key lesson:</strong> Over‑engineering and outdated technologies (Flash, heavy animations) create exclusionary experiences and damage performance. Simplicity and accessibility should always come first.
</p>

<h2>How to Turn a Bad Website into a Good One</h2>

<p>
  If you recognise any of the “bad” traits in your own site, don’t panic—each flaw has a straightforward fix:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Speed issues:</strong> Compress images, switch to a static site generator like Astro, and use a CDN. (We explain the technical steps in our <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth">speed optimization guide</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>PDF menus:</strong> Convert your menu to clean, searchable HTML. This improves both user experience and SEO. (See our <a href="/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo">PDF vs digital menu article</a> for a step‑by‑step process.)</li>
  <li><strong>Poor photography:</strong> Schedule a half‑day professional shoot focused on your signature dishes and venue atmosphere. The investment will lift perceived quality and increase menu conversion rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Weak local SEO:</strong> Claim and optimise your Google Business Profile, ensure NAP consistency across directories, and include suburb keywords naturally in your content.</li>
  <li><strong>Clunky booking system:</strong> Integrate a reliable reservation widget (like ResDiary or OpenTable) and place “Book a Table” buttons in multiple prominent spots.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The common thread across all the good examples is that they treat their website as a critical business asset—not just an online brochure. They invest in performance, visuals, and usability because they know that’s what today’s diners expect.
