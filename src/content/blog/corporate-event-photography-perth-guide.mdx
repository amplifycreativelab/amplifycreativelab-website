faq:
  - question: "How much does corporate event photography cost in Perth?"
    answer: "On average, a photographer charges $250–$500 per hour, but our studio charges $200 per hour the first time you book with us. Most corporate and hospitality events require 2-4 hours of coverage. Full-day conferences may be quoted at a day rate. Prices vary based on deliverables, turnaround time, and editing requirements."
  - question: "How far in advance should I book a corporate event photographer?"
    answer: "For major corporate events, conferences, or product launches, book 4-8 weeks in advance. Smaller functions and networking events can often be booked 2-3 weeks out, but popular dates (Christmas party season, financial year end) fill quickly."
  - question: "What should our team wear for corporate event photography?"

  - question: "How many photos will we receive from a corporate event?"
    answer: "A typical 2-3 hour corporate event yields 50-150 edited images, depending on the event size and variety of activities. We focus on quality and capturing key moments rather than delivering thousands of unusable shots."

Corporate events represent significant investments of time, money, and energy. Whether you're hosting a product launch in Northbridge, a conference at the Perth Convention Centre, or a networking function in South Perth, professional photography ensures you capture the value of that investment for marketing, internal communications, and future promotion.

This guide covers what to expect when hiring a corporate event photographer in Perth and how to prepare for the best possible results.

## Why Invest in Corporate Event Photography?

Before diving into logistics, let's clarify the business case:

| Use Case | Marketing Value |
|----------|----------------|
| Website "About" and "Team" pages | Shows your company culture in action |
| Social media content | Creates authentic, engaging posts |
| LinkedIn marketing | Professional images boost engagement 2-3x |
| Future event promotion | "Last year's conference" drives registrations |
| Internal newsletters | Boosts employee morale and engagement |
| Press releases | Media outlets need quality images |
| Investor and client presentations | Demonstrates activity and growth |

A single well-photographed event can provide months of marketing content across multiple platforms.

## What Happens Before the Event

### Initial Consultation

When you enquire about corporate event photography, expect to discuss:

- **Event Details:** Date, time, venue, expected attendance
- **Coverage Duration:** How many hours you need
- **Key Moments:** Speeches, awards, reveals, networking
- **Deliverables:** Number of images, turnaround time, formats
- **Budget:** Pricing is typically hourly with options for extras

For Perth corporate events, we'll also discuss:

- Venue specifics (lighting conditions, layout)
- Any access restrictions or media policies
- Parking and load-in requirements

### The Event Brief

The more detail you provide, the better your results. A good brief includes:

**Event Schedule**
- Registration opens: 6:00pm
- Welcome drinks: 6:00-6:30pm
- CEO presentation: 6:30-7:00pm
- Product reveal: 7:00pm
- Networking: 7:15-9:00pm

**Key People to Photograph**
- CEO (Jane Smith) - keynote speaker
- CTO (David Chen) - product demo
- Key clients: Company A, Company B representatives
- Board members (list with descriptions)

**Must-Have Shots**
- Product reveal moment
- CEO with keynote slide visible
- Group photo of leadership team
- Candid networking moments
- Venue branding and setup

**Shots to Avoid**
- Competitor signage in background
- Specific attendees who've opted out
- Catering setup (before presentation ready)

## What to Expect on the Day

### Photographer Arrival

A professional event photographer will typically:

- **Arrive 15-30 minutes early** to scout the venue and assess lighting
- **Check in with the event coordinator** to confirm schedule
- **Identify key photo opportunities** and plan positions
- **Set up backup equipment** (spare camera, batteries, memory cards)

### During the Event

Here's what happens during coverage:

**Candid Moments**
The photographer moves through the space capturing conversations, reactions, and atmosphere without interrupting the natural flow of events.

**Formal Moments**
For speeches, awards, or presentations, the photographer positions strategically to capture speakers, audience reactions, and any visual presentations.

**Directed Shots**
If your brief includes group photos or specific setups, we'll coordinate timing with your event manager.

**Minimal Intrusion**
A good event photographer is noticed but not intrusive. We dress appropriately, move quietly, and understand when to step back.

### Common Coverage Durations

| Event Type | Typical Coverage | Expected Images |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Networking drinks | 2 hours | 50-80 |
| Product launch | 3-4 hours | 100-150 |
| Half-day conference | 4-5 hours | 150-200 |
| Full-day conference | 8+ hours | 300-500 |
| Gala dinner | 4-5 hours | 150-200 |

## How to Prepare Your Event for Photography

### Venue Preparation

**Lighting**
- Confirm venue lighting can be adjusted if needed
- If in doubt, schedule the photo-intensive moments in well-lit areas
- Avoid positioning stages directly in front of bright windows

**Branding**
- Ensure company logos and event branding are visible
- Remove any temporary signage that should not appear in photos
- Check pull-up banners are straight and properly positioned

**Background**
- Clear clutter from visible areas
- Ensure exits and service areas won't distract from key shots

### Attendee Preparation

**Dress Code Communication**
Include photography expectations in your event invitation:

> "This event will be photographed for company communications and marketing. Please dress in smart business attire. If you prefer not to be photographed, please inform the event coordinator upon arrival."

**Key Personnel**
Brief your key people (executives, speakers, award winners) on:
- When and where they'll be photographed
- What backdrop or staging will be used
- How to pose for best results (we'll direct, but preparation helps)

### Designating a Contact Person

Assign one person as the photographer's point of contact. This person should:

- Know the event schedule intimately
- Be able to identify key attendees
- Have authority to make quick decisions
- Be available throughout the event (not a speaker or host)

This role is crucial at larger events where the photographer can't know everyone by sight.

## Maximising Your Event Photography Investment

### Plan "Photo Moments" Into Your Schedule

Rather than hoping great shots happen organically, build photography-friendly moments into your timeline:

**Before the event:**
- Capture the venue setup (empty space, branding, catering)
- Staged shots of the product or materials

**During registration:**
- Welcome signage and check-in process
- Early arrivals in the empty-but-ready space

**Content moments:**
- Speakers at key presentation moments
- Audience engagement shots (reactions, note-taking)
- Product reveals or demonstrations

**Networking:**
- Candid conversations
- Business card exchanges
- Groups forming organically

**End of event:**
- Final group shot (if planned)
- Thank-you moments
- Venue at its busiest

### Quick-Turnaround Options

Need images for same-day social media? Discuss this in advance. Options include:

- **Same-day previews:** 5-10 lightly edited images within 2-3 hours
- **Live posting coordination:** Photographer sends RAW files to your team for quick posting
- **Next-morning delivery:** Full set edited overnight

These options may affect pricing but ensure you can capitalise on event momentum.

### Maximising Content Value

After the event, think beyond just posting photos:

**Immediate (0-48 hours)**
- Post highlights to LinkedIn and Instagram
- Share with attendees via email
- Update event registration pages with "last year's event" content

**Short-term (1-4 weeks)**
- Create blog post recap
- Add to company newsletter
- Update website team and culture pages

**Long-term (ongoing)**
- Use in future event promotion
- Include in client presentations
- Add to recruitment marketing
- Feature in annual reports

## What Happens After the Event

### Turnaround Times

Standard corporate event photography turnaround:

- **Preview images:** 24-48 hours (5-10 highlights for social media)
- **Full edited gallery:** 5-10 business days
- **Large conferences:** 10-15 business days

Rush delivery is available for an additional fee.

### Deliverables

You'll typically receive:

- **High-resolution images** (suitable for print and large displays)
- **Web-optimised versions** (sized for websites and social media)
- **Online gallery** for easy sharing with team members
- **Full digital rights** for business use

### Editing and Selection

We cull and edit on your behalf, delivering only the best images. A typical 3-hour event might generate 300+ RAW files, but you'll receive 100-150 fully edited final images.

If you have specific preferences (colour grading style, black and white options), discuss these in advance.

## Perth-Specific Considerations

### Popular Corporate Event Venues

Perth's corporate event scene centres around several key areas:

**Perth CBD**
- Perth Convention Centre
- State Library of Western Australia
- Crown Towers Perth
- Ritz-Carlton Perth

**Northbridge**
- Rooftop venues
- Art Gallery of Western Australia
- Shadow Wine Bar
- Mechanics Institute

**South Perth**
- The Boatshed
- Sir James Mitchell Park (outdoor events)
- Old Mill Theatre precinct

**Fremantle**
- Fremantle Arts Centre
- Breakwater Apartments
- Maritime Museum

Each venue has unique lighting and layout considerations—share your venue choice early for best preparation.

### Seasonal Considerations

**Corporate Christmas Events (November-December)**
Book early—this is the busiest season for corporate photography in Perth. Venues and photographers alike book out quickly.

**End of Financial Year (June)**
Second busiest period. Awards nights and team celebrations cluster around this time.

**Conference Season (March-May, September-November)**
Major conferences and industry events fill these periods. Allow extra lead time for equipment hire.

**Summer Outdoor Events (December-February)**
Natural light is beautiful but harsh. Timing matters—early morning or late afternoon events photograph best.

## Choosing the Right Photographer

When evaluating Perth corporate event photographers, consider:

**Portfolio Relevance**
Do they have experience with your event type? A wedding photographer may not excel at corporate networking events.

**Technical Capability**
Can they handle challenging venue lighting? Do they bring backup equipment? Low-light capability matters for evening functions.

**Communication Style**
Are they responsive and easy to brief? Corporate events require flexibility and clear communication.

**Cultural Fit**
Will they dress and behave appropriately for your corporate environment?

**References**
Can they provide references from similar clients?
