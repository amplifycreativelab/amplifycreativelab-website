faq:
  - question: "How much does a food photography agency cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Agencies typically charge either by the project ($1,500 - $5,000+) or by the day ($1,200 - $2,500). While higher than some freelancers, agencies often include styling, editing, and strategy in the package, delivering higher ROI."
  - question: "What is the difference between a freelancer and an agency?"
    answer: "Freelancers are often solo operators who take great photos. Agencies bring a team approach: strategy, styling, post-production, and often broader marketing expertise (like SEO or social media) to ensure the photos actually drive sales."
  - question: "Do I need a food stylist?"
    answer: "For hero shots and menu engineering, yes. A stylist ensures food looks appetizing and holds up under lights. Many agencies include styling capabilities, whereas with freelancers you might need to hire a separate stylist."
  - question: "Who owns the photos after the shoot?"
    answer: "Always check the contract. Standard industry practice is for the client to receive a license to use the images. At Amplify, we provide broad commercial usage rights so you can use your images across menus, social, web, and ads without hidden fees."

</aside>

In the visual-first world of Instagram and UberEats, the quality of your food photography directly correlates with your revenue. For Perth hospitality owners, the question isn't *if* you need professional photos—it's *who* should take them.

Should you hire a solo freelancer? A full-service agency? Or just give the newest iPhone to your front-of-house manager?

This guide breaks down the pros, cons, and costs of each option to help you make the right decision for your venue.

## Option 1: The DIY Approach (Do It Yourself)

**Best for:** Daily social media stories, very small cafes starting out, "behind the scenes" authenticity.

### Pros
*   **Zero Cost:** You already own a phone.
*   **Immediacy:** Snap and post instantly.
*   **Authenticity:** Raw, unfiltered content works well for TikTok and Stories.

### Cons
*   **Inconsistency:** Lighting, style, and quality vary wildly.
*   **Lack of Appetite Appeal:** Bad lighting makes food look unappealing (grey meat, yellow tint).
*   **Brand Damage:** Low-quality images suggest low-quality food.
*   **Unusable for Print/Web:** Phone photos often lack the resolution or quality for large menus or website hero banners.

**Verdict:** Use DIY for *Stories*, not your *Menu* or *Website*.

## Option 2: The Solo Freelancer

**Best for:** Specific artistic projects, one-off shoots, venues with a clear internal creative direction.

### Pros
*   **Artistic Vision:** Many freelancers have a distinct, beautiful style.
*   **Cost Effective:** Generally cheaper than an agency ($200-$400/hr).
*   **Direct Communication:** You speak directly to the artist.

### Cons
*   **Single Point of Failure:** If they get sick, your shoot is cancelled.
*   **Limited Scope:** They might take great photos but lack knowledge of marketing, SEO, or web optimisation.
*   **Equipment Limits:** May have less gear/lighting options than a studio.
*   **Variable Reliability:** Quality and professionalism can vary significantly.

**Verdict:** Great for specific artistic needs if you have a creative director to manage them.

## Option 3: The Food Photography Agency

**Best for:** Restaurants serious about growth, venues needing consistent brand assets, multi-venue groups.

### Pros
*   **Strategic Approach:** Agencies shoot to *sell*, not just to look pretty. They understand [menu engineering](/blog/menu-engineering-decoy-dish-strategy-perth) and marketing.
*   **Reliability:** A team means backups, systems, and consistent delivery.
*   **Scalabiltiy:** Can handle large menus, video, and drone shots in one package.
*   **Integrated Services:** Often can help with web design, social strategy, and SEO (like we do at Amplify).
*   **Post-Production Power:** Dedicated editors ensure perfect colour grading and retouching.

### Cons
*   **Higher Investment:** Expect to pay $1,500+ for a comprehensive shoot package.
*   **Process:** Might require more formal booking and planning than a quick freelancer text.

**Verdict:** The best ROI for businesses where visual brand equity translates to bookings.

## What to Look for in a Perth Agency

Not all agencies are created equal. When vetting partners in Perth:

1.  **Check their Portfolio:** Do they shoot venues similar to yours? (e.g. Fine dining vs Smash burgers).
2.  **Ask about Styling:** Do they plate the food, or do you need a chef present?
3.  **Web Knowledge:** Do they provide [web-optimised visuals](/blog/how-image-compression-impacts-seo-why-photographers-get-it-wrong) (WebP) or just giant JPEGs?
4.  **Local Knowledge:** Do they understand the Perth market, from [Fremantle](/blog/fremantle-hospitality-digital-guide) to the CBD?

## The Amplify Difference
