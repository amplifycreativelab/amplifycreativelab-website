faq:
  - question: "What makes festival photography different from other event photography?"
    answer: "Festival photography requires capturing energy, movement, and atmosphere in unpredictable outdoor conditions. You need fast reflexes for candid moments, gear suited for variable lighting, and the ability to tell a story across multiple locations and activities simultaneously."
  - question: "How much does festival photography cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Perth festival photography typically ranges from $200-400/hour for single photographers, $1,500-3,000 for half-day coverage, and $2,500-5,000+ for full-day multi-photographer coverage. Brand activations often require custom quotes based on deliverables and usage rights."
  - question: "What equipment is essential for outdoor market photography?"
    answer: "Essential gear includes: weather-sealed camera body, fast zoom lens (24-70mm f/2.8), wide-angle lens (16-35mm), portable flash with diffuser, extra batteries (outdoor shooting drains faster), memory cards, and comfortable bag. Consider also a monopod for stability."
  - question: "How far in advance should I book a festival photographer?"
    answer: "Book your photographer 4-8 weeks before major festivals like Fringe World or Christmas markets. For smaller markets, 2-4 weeks is usually sufficient. Popular dates (weekends in summer, public holidays) book quickly—secure key events 2-3 months ahead."
  - question: "Can I use festival photos for advertising?"
    answer: "Yes, with appropriate model releases for identifiable people. Professional photographers typically include releases in their workflow. Crowd shots where individuals aren't identifiable generally don't require releases, but specific faces being used in advertising need consent."
  - question: "What's the best time of day to photograph outdoor markets?"
    answer: "Golden hour (1-2 hours before sunset) provides the most flattering light. For Perth summer markets, this is around 5-7pm. Morning markets benefit from soft early light (7-9am). Midday harsh sun creates challenges—seek shade or use fill flash."
  - question: "How do you photograph brand activations effectively?"
    answer: "Document: brand signage and setup, crowd engagement moments, product interactions, staff and ambassador shots, sponsor visibility, behind-the-scenes setup, and guest reactions. Capture both wide establishing shots and intimate detail moments."
  - question: "What's included in festival photography packages?"
    answer: "Typical packages include: on-site photography for specified hours, basic editing and colour correction, online gallery delivery, usage rights for marketing, and specified number of edited images. Add-ons include same-day previews, video clips, extended usage rights, and printing."
