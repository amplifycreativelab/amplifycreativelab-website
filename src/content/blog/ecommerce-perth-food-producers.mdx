faq:
  - question: "Do I need a licence to sell food online in Western Australia?"
    answer: "Yes. WA food businesses must register with their local council and comply with Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) regulations. You'll need proper food handling procedures, labelling compliance, and potentially a commercial kitchen depending on your product type."
  - question: "What's the best e-commerce platform for a small Perth food producer?"
    answer: "Shopify is the most popular choice for its ease of use and food-business-friendly features. Square Online works well if you're already using Square POS. WooCommerce offers more control but requires more technical knowledge. Start simple and scale as you grow."
  - question: "How much does it cost to set up an e-commerce store for food products?"
    answer: "Budget $2,000-$8,000 for initial setup including professional photography, platform subscription, and basic design. Ongoing costs include platform fees ($29-299/month), payment processing (1.5-2.9%), and shipping supplies. Many producers see ROI within 6-12 months."
  - question: "What photography do I need for selling food products online?"
    answer: "Essential shots include: clean product-on-white images for listings, lifestyle photos showing the product in use, ingredient or provenance shots, and packaging/unboxing images. Invest in professional food photography—it directly impacts conversion rates."
  - question: "How do I handle shipping perishable food products?"
    answer: "Options include overnight/express shipping with cold packs or dry ice, local delivery only for highly perishable items, partnering with specialist food couriers, or focusing on shelf-stable products for shipping. Clearly state shipping limitations upfront."
  - question: "Should I sell through marketplaces or my own website?"
    answer: "Ideally both. Your own website gives you control, better margins, and customer data. Marketplaces (Farmers Market Direct, Good Food Warehouse) provide exposure and trust. Start where your customers are, then drive them to your own platform."
  - question: "What payment options should I offer for food e-commerce?"
    answer: "At minimum, offer credit/debit cards through Stripe or Square. Add Buy Now Pay Later options like Afterpay for larger orders. PayPal adds trust for new customers. Apple Pay and Google Pay improve mobile checkout conversion."
  - question: "How do I price products for online sale including shipping?"
    answer: "Calculate your true costs: product, packaging, labour, platform fees, payment processing, and shipping. Add your margin. Many producers offer free shipping over a threshold ($80-150) to encourage larger orders. Consider local pickup to save on shipping costs."

</aside>

Western Australia's food scene is flourishing. From Margaret River olive oils to Swan Valley preserves, Fremantle coffee roasters to Perth CBD artisan bakeries—local producers are creating world-class products. But many still rely solely on farmers' markets, wholesale, or physical retail.

E-commerce opens a new channel: selling directly to WA households (and beyond) who want quality local food delivered to their door. This guide covers everything Perth food producers need to know about building a successful online store.

## The Case for Food Producer E-commerce

### Why Sell Online Now?

Consumer behaviour has shifted permanently:

| Trend | Impact on Food Producers |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Direct-to-consumer growth | 40%+ increase since 2020 |
| Local food preference | 73% of WA shoppers prefer local products |
| Subscription models | Recurring revenue opportunity |
| Gift hamper demand | Strong gift market for quality food |
| Story-driven purchases | Buyers want to know the producer |

Online sales complement rather than replace existing channels. Your farmers' market customers become subscription buyers. Restaurant customers discover your retail products.

### What Can You Sell Online?

WA food producers selling successfully online include:

**Shelf-stable (easiest to ship):**
- Olive oils and vinegars
- Jams, preserves, and chutneys
- Honey
- Coffee and tea
- Sauces and condiments
- Dried goods (pasta, grains, snacks)
- Chocolates and confectionery

**Cold-chain required (more complex):**
- Cheese
- Charcuterie
- Fresh produce (limited range)
- Prepared meals
- Specialty meats

**Local delivery only:**
- Fresh baked goods
- Highly perishable items
- Bulk fresh produce

Start with products that ship easily, then expand as you develop logistics capabilities.

## Compliance and Legal Requirements

### Food Business Registration

Before selling online, ensure your business complies with WA requirements:

**Essential compliance:**
1. **Food business registration** with your local council
2. **Food safety program** appropriate to your risk level
3. **Commercial kitchen** (if required for your product type)
4. **Product liability insurance** (highly recommended)

**Labelling requirements (FSANZ):**
- Product name and description
- Ingredient list (descending order by weight)
- Allergen declarations
- Net weight or volume
- Best before or use by date
- Producer name and address
- Country of origin
- Nutritional information (if making claims)

Get labelling wrong and you risk recalls, fines, or worse. Consult with a food business advisor before launching online sales.

### Shipping Compliance

Food shipping adds additional considerations:

- Temperature control requirements
- Packaging that protects product integrity
- Clear handling instructions for couriers
- Interstate quarantine restrictions (some fresh produce)

For complex products, work with a food logistics specialist.

## Choosing Your E-commerce Platform

### Platform Comparison for Food Producers

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Transaction Fee | Best For |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Shopify** | $29-399 | 0.5-2% + payment | Standalone food brands |
| **Square Online** | $0-79 | 2.6% + 10c | Already using Square POS |
| **WooCommerce** | Hosting ($10-50) | Payment only | Tech-comfortable producers |
| **BigCommerce** | $39-399 | 0% (payment only) | High-volume sellers |

### Shopify: The Go-To Choice

Most Perth food producers choose Shopify because:

**Pros:**
- Intuitive, easy to use without technical skills
- Food-specific apps for subscriptions, local delivery
- Excellent mobile experience
- Built-in payment processing
- Scales as you grow

**Cons:**
- Monthly fees add up
- Transaction fees unless using Shopify Payments
- Some advanced features require premium plans

**Food-specific Shopify apps:**
- **Recharge**: Subscription management
- **Zapiet**: Local delivery and pickup
- **Product Reviews**: Social proof
- **Klaviyo**: Email marketing

### Square Online: POS Integration

If you're already using Square at markets or retail:

**Pros:**
- Unified inventory across online and in-person
- Simple setup, familiar interface
- Free tier available
- Integrated with Square ecosystem

**Cons:**
- Less customisation than Shopify
- Fewer food-specific apps
- Basic design options

### WooCommerce: Maximum Control

For technically inclined producers:

**Pros:**
- Open source, highly customisable
- Lower ongoing costs (hosting + payment only)
- Full control over design and functionality
- No transaction fees beyond payment processor

**Cons:**
- Requires WordPress knowledge
- You manage hosting, security, updates
- More time investment to set up

## Building Your Online Store

### Essential Pages for Food E-commerce

- Featured products or collections
- Trust signals (certifications, awards, media features)

**Product Pages:**

### Design Considerations

Your website should reflect your product quality:

**Photography:**

- Show products in use (olive oil drizzled on salad)
- Include packaging and unboxing imagery
- Lifestyle shots that communicate your brand

**Typography:**
- Clean, readable fonts
- Avoid overly decorative scripts for body text
- Consistent hierarchy across pages

**Colour palette:**
- Draw from your packaging/brand
- Earthy, natural tones often suit food brands
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

**Mobile optimisation:**

## Product Photography That Sells

### Photography Investment

Photography directly impacts sales. Budget accordingly:

| Image Type | Purpose | Investment |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Product on white | E-commerce listings | Essential |
| Lifestyle shots | Social media, hero images | Essential |
| Ingredient shots | Story and quality communication | Recommended |
| Process/making of | About page, social content | Nice to have |
| Gift hamper images | Hamper sales | If selling hampers |

Professional [product photography](/perth-product-photography/) typically costs $50-150 per product (multiple angles). The investment pays back through increased conversions.

### DIY Photography Guidelines

If budgets are tight, basic in-house photography can work:

**Setup essentials:**
- Natural light near a large window
- White or neutral background
- Tripod for consistency
- Clean products and props

**Avoid:**
- Cluttered backgrounds
- Mixed lighting (natural + artificial)
- Blurry or dark images
- Inconsistent styles across products

**When to upgrade:**
- Product range grows beyond 20 items
- Launching wholesale or retail partnerships
- Running paid advertising
- Seeking media coverage

## Shipping and Fulfilment

### Packaging Considerations

Your packaging must:

1. **Protect products** from damage and temperature
2. **Reflect brand quality** (unboxing experience)
3. **Meet sustainability expectations** (WA buyers prefer eco options)
4. **Stay cost-effective** (impacts margin significantly)

**Packaging elements:**
- Outer box (branded or plain)
- Inner protection (recycled paper, straw, bubble)
- Cold packs or insulation (if needed)
- Thank you card or insert
- Return/care instructions

### Shipping Pricing Models

## Case Study: Swan Valley Olive Producer

A Swan Valley olive oil producer approached us to establish online sales:

**Starting position:**
- Selling at markets and through local retailers
- No website or online presence
- Strong product and local reputation
- Limited technical knowledge

**What we built:**
- Shopify store with regional shipping
- Professional product and lifestyle photography
- Subscription option for repeat customers
- Integration with existing market operations

**Results after 12 months:**
- Online sales: 35% of total revenue
- 180 active subscribers
- 40% of market customers now also buy online
- Average order value: $85

The key was connecting their existing customer base to the new online channel, then expanding reach through SEO and targeted social advertising.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Shipping Complexity

**Problem:** Assuming Australia Post handles everything, then facing damaged products and customer complaints.

**Solution:** Test your shipping thoroughly before launch. Send products to friends in different locations. Invest in proper packaging.

### Mistake 2: Poor Product Photography

**Problem:** Using phone photos that don't convey product quality, leading to low conversion rates.

**Solution:** Budget for professional photography. Your products are premium—imagery should match.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Mobile Experience

**Problem:** Building on desktop, never testing on mobile where most customers shop.

**Solution:** Design mobile-first. Test the entire purchase flow on a phone before launching.

### Mistake 4: Setting and Forgetting

**Problem:** Launching the store and expecting sales without ongoing marketing or optimisation.

**Solution:** Treat e-commerce as a channel requiring consistent attention—content, email, social, and improvement.

### Mistake 5: Not Telling Your Story

**Problem:** Just listing products without the producer story that WA buyers want.

**Solution:** Your story is your differentiator. Share the why, the who, and the where behind your products.
