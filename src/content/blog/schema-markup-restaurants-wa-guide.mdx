faq:
  - question: "Do I need schema markup if I already have a Google Business Profile?"
    answer: "Yes. Google Business Profile provides basic local data, but schema markup on your website gives Google additional context about your menu, events, and products. The two work together to maximise your visibility in both organic search and the local pack."
  - question: "How long does it take for schema to affect my search results?"
    answer: "Once Google crawls your updated pages (usually within a few days to a week), you may start seeing rich results. However, the impact on rankings and click‑through rates can take several weeks to become noticeable, depending on competition and search volume."
  - question: "Can I add schema markup to a WordPress site without coding?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Plugins like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, and Schema Pro offer user‑friendly interfaces for adding structured data. For more complex implementations (e.g., custom menu schemas), a developer may still be needed."
  - question: "What's the difference between JSON‑LD and microdata?"
    answer: "JSON‑LD is a script‑based format that's easier to implement and maintain, while microdata involves adding attributes directly to your HTML elements. Google recommends JSON‑LD because it's less error‑prone and doesn't interfere with your page's visual design."

<p>
  <strong>Schema markup is a form of structured data that tells Google exactly what your restaurant offers—from your menu items and opening hours to customer reviews and price range.</strong> For Perth venues, implementing the right schema can mean the difference between appearing as a plain blue link and standing out with rich snippets that attract up to 30% more clicks. This guide walks you through the essential schema types for WA hospitality businesses, how to implement them correctly, and common pitfalls to avoid.
</p>

<p>
  According to a study by Search Engine Land, <strong>websites with proper schema markup see an average 30% higher click‑through rate (CTR) in search results</strong>. In a competitive market like Perth's hospitality scene, that extra visibility can translate directly into more covers, higher online bookings, and a stronger local SEO presence. If your restaurant isn't using schema, you're missing out on one of the most effective—and often overlooked—tools for driving traffic.
</p>

<h2>What Is Schema Markup?</h2>

<p>
  Schema markup (also called structured data) is a standardized vocabulary of tags that you add to your website's HTML. These tags help search engines understand the content on your pages, enabling them to display <strong>rich results</strong>—enhanced search listings that include extra information like star ratings, price ranges, menu items, and event dates.
</p>

<p>
  The most common format for schema is <strong>JSON‑LD</strong> (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data), a script that you place in the `<head>` section of your page. Unlike traditional meta tags, JSON‑LD doesn't affect how your page looks to visitors; it's purely for search engines. When Google crawls your site, it reads this structured data and uses it to generate more informative and attractive search results.
</p>

<h2>Why Schema Matters for Perth Restaurants</h2>

<p>
  Local SEO is fiercely competitive in Perth. When someone searches for "best pizza Northbridge" or "Fremantle café with vegan options," Google wants to deliver the most relevant, trustworthy results. Schema markup helps your venue stand out in three key ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Rich snippets:</strong> Your listing can show star ratings, price indicators, "Open now" badges, and even individual menu items—all of which increase visibility and click‑through rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Better understanding:</strong> Schema tells Google that your page is about a specific restaurant, not just a generic food blog. This improves your chances of ranking for local intent queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Voice‑search readiness:</strong> As more customers use voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, structured data helps your venue appear in answer boxes for queries like "Where's a good Italian restaurant near me?"
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For example, a Perth restaurant with proper <code>LocalBusiness</code> and <code>Menu</code> schema might appear in search results with its rating, price range, and a direct link to its menu—while a competitor without schema remains a plain text link. In a split‑second decision, which one do you think the customer will click?
</p>

<h2>Key Schema Types for Hospitality Businesses</h2>

<p>
  Not all schema is created equal. For restaurants, cafés, bars and event venues in WA, focus on these five core types:
</p>

<h3>1. LocalBusiness & Restaurant</h3>

<p>
  The <code>LocalBusiness</code> schema defines your venue's name, address, phone number (NAP), opening hours, and geo‑coordinates. The more specific <code>Restaurant</code> type adds cuisine, price range, and accepts reservations. This is the foundation of your local SEO and is essential for appearing in Google's local pack and Maps.
</p>

<h3>2. Menu & MenuItem</h3>

<p>
  The <code>Menu</code> schema allows you to mark up your entire digital menu, linking each dish to a <code>MenuItem</code> that includes the name, description, price, and dietary information (vegan, gluten‑free, etc.). This not only helps Google understand your offerings but can also trigger <strong>menu rich results</strong> that display dishes directly in search.
</p>

<h3>3. Product (for Individual Dishes)</h3>

<p>
  If you sell packaged goods (e.g., sauces, gift hampers, bottled drinks) or want to highlight signature dishes as products, the <code>Product</code> schema provides additional fields for SKU, brand, and availability. This is especially useful for e‑commerce or online ordering integrations.
</p>

<h3>4. Review & AggregateRating</h3>

<p>
  Showcasing your reviews with <code>AggregateRating</code> schema can display your star rating and review count in search results, building instant trust. Each individual review can be marked up with <code>Review</code> schema, though this is often handled automatically by platforms like Google Business Profile.
</p>

<h3>5. Event (for Special Events & Promotions)</h3>

<p>
  Hosting a wine‑pairing dinner, a launch party, or a seasonal festival? The <code>Event</code> schema lets you specify the event's name, date, location, and ticket information, making it more likely to appear in event‑based searches and Google's event carousels.
</p>

<h2>How to Implement Schema Markup</h2>

<p>
  Adding schema to your site doesn't require a degree in computer science. Follow these steps to get started:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Identify the relevant schema types</strong> for your venue (start with <code>LocalBusiness</code> and <code>Menu</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use Google's Structured Data Markup Helper</strong> to generate the JSON‑LD code. Simply paste your URL, highlight elements on the page, and assign schema properties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate the code</strong> with Google's Rich Results Test to ensure there are no errors or warnings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Insert the JSON‑LD script</strong> into the `<head>` of your page. If you're using a CMS like WordPress, plugins like Yoast SEO or Rank Math can automate much of this process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor performance</strong> in Google Search Console's "Enhancements" reports to see which rich results are being generated and how often they appear in search.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  For a hands‑off approach, consider working with a developer who understands both schema and the hospitality industry. At Amplify Creative Lab, we bake schema markup into every website we build, ensuring your Perth venue gets the maximum SEO benefit from day one.

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p>
  Even well‑intentioned schema implementations can go wrong. Watch out for these frequent errors:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Missing required properties:</strong> Each schema type has mandatory fields. Omitting them can cause Google to ignore your markup.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inconsistent NAP details:</strong> Your schema address must match exactly what's listed on your Google Business Profile and other directories.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Outdated menu information:</strong> If you change your menu seasonally, remember to update the <code>Menu</code> and <code>MenuItem</code> schema accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Over‑stuffing with irrelevant schema:</strong> Adding schema that doesn't match your content (e.g., marking up a blog post as a <code>Product</code>) can confuse Google and hurt your credibility.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The safest approach is to start simple, validate thoroughly, and expand gradually as you become more comfortable with structured data.
