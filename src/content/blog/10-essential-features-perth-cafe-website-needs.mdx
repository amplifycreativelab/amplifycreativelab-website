<h3>1. Mobile‑First Design</h3>
<p>
  Over 70% of searches for cafés and restaurants in Perth happen on mobile devices. If your site isn't optimised for smartphones and tablets, you're alienating the majority of your potential customers. A mobile‑first design ensures your menu, contact details, and booking buttons are easy to tap and read on any screen size.
</p>
<p>
  Over 70% of searches for cafés and restaurants in Perth happen on mobile devices. If your site isn't optimised for smartphones and tablets, you're alienating the majority of your potential customers. A mobile‑first design ensures your menu, contact details, and booking buttons are easy to tap and read on any screen size.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why it matters for Perth cafés:</strong> Tourists exploring Fremantle, office workers grabbing a quick coffee in the CBD, and families planning a weekend brunch in Subiaco all rely on their phones. A mobile‑friendly site keeps them engaged and reduces bounce rates.
</p>

<h3>2. Fast Loading Speed</h3>
<p>
  Research shows that 40% of users will abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to load. For hungry customers, every second counts. Fast loading speeds improve user experience, boost your <strong>Google Core Web Vitals</strong> scores, and directly impact your search rankings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How to achieve it:</strong> Use optimised images (WebP format), leverage browser caching, and choose a hosting provider with a local CDN. Perth‑based hosting can shave valuable milliseconds off load times for local visitors.

</p>

<h3>3. Clear Contact Information & Location</h3>
<p>
  Your address, phone number, opening hours, and a click‑to‑call button should be visible on every page—preferably in the header or footer. Embed a Google Maps widget with precise coordinates so customers can find you instantly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perth‑specific tip:</strong> Mention nearby landmarks (“opposite the Perth Concert Hall,” “next to the Fremantle Markets”) to help first‑time visitors orient themselves. Always keep your Google Business Profile details synchronised with your website.
</p>

<h3>4. Online Booking & Reservation System</h3>
<p>
  A built‑in booking system eliminates phone tag and lets customers secure a table at any time of day. Integration with popular platforms like ResDiary, OpenTable, or a simple Calendly widget can increase bookings by up to 30%.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>For Perth cafés with limited seating:</strong> A reservation system helps manage peak periods (weekend brunches, public holidays) and reduces no‑shows with automated reminders.
</p>

<h3>5. Digital Menu with High‑Quality Food Photography</h3>
<p>
  A static PDF menu is a conversion killer. Instead, build your menu directly into your website using clean HTML that Google can read. Pair each dish with professional <strong>food photography</strong> that showcases your offerings in their best light.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The visual advantage:</strong> Mouth‑watering images of your coffee, pastries, and signature dishes can increase average order value by 15–25%. For Perth cafés, styling that reflects local trends—coastal vibes, industrial chic, or rustic warmth—helps you connect with your target audience.

</p>

<h3>6. Social Media Integration</h3>
<p>
  Display live Instagram feeds, encourage check‑ins, and make it easy to share your menu or specials. Social proof builds trust and turns your customers into brand ambassadors.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perth café example:</strong> A live feed of tagged photos from your Northbridge or Leederville location shows real people enjoying your space, creating a sense of community and authenticity.
</p>

<h3>7. Customer Reviews & Testimonials</h3>
<p>
  Positive reviews are the modern word‑of‑mouth. Feature Google, Facebook, or TripAdvisor reviews prominently on your homepage and dedicate a page to customer stories. Responding to reviews—both positive and negative—shows you value feedback.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Local credibility:</strong> Highlight reviews that mention your Perth location, friendly staff, or specific dishes to reinforce your local authority.
</p>

<h3>8. SEO Optimization for Local Search</h3>
<p>
  To appear when someone searches “best coffee Perth” or “café near me,” your site needs local SEO fundamentals. This includes location‑based keywords, schema markup (LocalBusiness, Café), and consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) citations across the web.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Perth‑focused keywords:</strong> Incorporate suburb names (e.g., “café in Mount Lawley,” “breakfast in Subiaco”) and local attractions naturally into your content. A blog about Perth’s coffee culture can also drive organic traffic.
</p>

<h3>9. Accessibility & WCAG Compliance</h3>
<p>
  An accessible website ensures everyone—including people with disabilities—can use your site. Simple measures like sufficient colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and alt text for images not only broaden your audience but also reduce legal risk.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why it matters in hospitality:</strong> Perth cafés that welcome all customers, regardless of ability, build a reputation for inclusivity and social responsibility. Accessibility improvements often improve overall usability for all visitors.
</p>

<h3>10. Analytics & Performance Tracking</h3>
<p>
  You can't improve what you don't measure. Install Google Analytics (or a privacy‑friendly alternative) to track visitor behaviour, popular menu items, booking conversions, and traffic sources. Regular reviews help you refine your marketing and site content.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Actionable insights:</strong> See which Perth suburbs bring the most traffic, which dishes get the most clicks, and where users drop off in the booking flow. Use that data to make informed decisions about promotions, menu changes, and advertising.
</p>
