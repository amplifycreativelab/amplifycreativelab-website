faq:
  - question: "How is food truck photography different from restaurant photography?"
    answer: "Food truck photography happens in smaller, dynamic spaces with changing lighting conditions. You need to capture the truck itself as a hero, show food in authentic 'on-the-go' contexts, and create content that works across multiple market locations. There's also more emphasis on queue appeal and passing traffic."
  - question: "How much should a food truck budget for photography?"
    answer: "Perth food trucks typically invest $300-800 for a comprehensive shoot covering menu items, truck exterior, action shots, and social content. This provides 6-12 months of marketing assets. Ongoing social content shoots might be $150-300 per market appearance."
  - question: "What makes food truck photos perform well on social media?"
    answer: "High-performing food truck content shows: food being handed through the window (action), steam rising from fresh-cooked items, queues of customers (social proof), the truck in market context (location), close-up hero shots (appetite appeal), and behind-the-scenes cooking."
  - question: "Should I photograph food in the truck or set up elsewhere?"
    answer: "Capture both. In-truck/window shots showcase authenticity and the unique food truck experience. Styled shots on a separate surface give you clean hero images for menus and advertising. The combination covers all marketing needs."
  - question: "How do I get good photos in a cramped food truck?"
    answer: "Use wide-angle lenses to make spaces feel larger, shoot through the service window from outside, capture hand-off moments, focus on chef's hands rather than full body, and use natural light from windows. Position reflectors strategically to fill shadows."
  - question: "What time of day is best for food truck photography?"
    answer: "Golden hour (evening markets 5-7pm in summer) creates beautiful warm light. Morning shoots before markets open allow for controlled hero shots. Midday harsh Perth sun is challenging—use the truck's shadow or wait for clouds."
  - question: "How many photos do I need for a food truck launch?"
    answer: "For a comprehensive launch: 3-5 hero shots of signature dishes, 2-3 exterior truck shots, 3-5 action/prep shots, 5-10 social media lifestyle images, and headshots of founders. That's 15-25 final edited images minimum."
  - question: "Can I do good food truck photography with a smartphone?"
    answer: "Yes, modern smartphones produce quality images, especially in good lighting. Focus on natural light, clean styling, and interesting angles. For professional marketing materials, a photographer with proper equipment will deliver superior results, especially in challenging market lighting."

Perth's food truck scene has exploded—from twilight markets to beachfront pop-ups, mobile kitchens are redefining how we eat. But in a crowded market where people make split-second decisions walking past trucks, your food photography is often the difference between a long queue and an empty window.

This guide covers everything food truck operators need to know about photography that drives foot traffic, builds social following, and justifies premium pricing.

## Why Food Truck Photography Is Different

### The Unique Challenges

Food trucks face photography challenges restaurants don't:

| Challenge | Impact | Solution |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Small, cramped spaces** | Hard to style and shoot | Outside shots, wide angles |
| **Variable lighting** | Different at every market | Adaptable techniques |
| **No permanent setup** | Can't leave backdrops in place | Portable styling kit |
| **Fast service requirements** | Can't hold food for long shoots | Quick, planned shots |
| **Weather exposure** | Wind, sun, dust affecting food | Covered prep areas |
| **Multiple venues** | Need location-flexible content | Generic and specific shots |

### Your Competition is Visual

At any given market, customers see 10-30 food options. Their decision process:

1. **See your truck** (exterior appeal)
2. **Glance at menu board** (photography quality)
3. **Check their phone** (Instagram presence)
4. **Join or skip** (queue judgment)

Quality photography impacts all four stages.

## Essential Photo Categories for Food Trucks

### 1. Hero Dish Photography

Your signature items deserve magazine-quality treatment:

**What to capture:**
- Each menu item as a standalone hero
- Close-up texture and ingredient detail
- Multiple angles for variety
- Fresh, just-cooked presentation

**Styling requirements:**
- Clean, simple backgrounds
- Props that suggest your cuisine style
- Consistent brand colour elements
- Portion sizes that look generous

**Usage:**
- Menu boards at markets
- Website and ordering apps
- Print menus and flyers
- Social media highlight posts

### 2. Truck Exterior Shots

Your truck is a moving billboard—photograph it like one:

**Essential angles:**
- Service window straight-on
- Three-quarter front angle
- Full side profile
- Detail shots of branding/graphics

**Context variations:**
- Against clean backdrop (versatile)
- At market in action (atmosphere)
- Scenic Perth locations (lifestyle)
- Evening with lights (mood)

**Why it matters:**
- Event organisers request truck photos for promotion
- Location scouts need to visualise your presence
- Press and media use exterior shots

### 3. Action and Process Shots

Show the making, not just the made:

**Capture moments:**
- Flames on grill/wok
- Chef hands in motion
- Fresh ingredients being prepped
- Food being plated/assembled
- Window hand-off to customer

**Why action sells:**
- Creates authenticity and trust
- Shows skill and care
- Differentiates from static competitors
- Performs well on TikTok/Reels

### 4. Service Window Moments

The "window shot" is food truck gold:

**Compositions to capture:**
- Food passing through window
- Customer receiving order
- Staff smile and hand-off
- View from inside looking out
- Queue waiting at window

**Tip:** This single frame tells the whole story—food, service, atmosphere, and the unique truck experience.

### 5. Customer Experience Content

Real people enjoying your food:

**Capture:**
- First bite reactions
- Friends sharing dishes
- Families at market tables
- Solo diners appreciating food
- Social media moments (people photographing food)

**Permissions:**
- Ask before photographing identifiable individuals
- Offer free dish for willing participants
- Best captured during golden hour buzz

### 6. Behind-the-Scenes Content

Let followers inside your world:

**Content ideas:**
- Morning prep and ingredient sourcing
- Market setup process
- Team briefings and energy
- Equipment and unique truck features
- Recipe development moments

**Platform fit:**
- Instagram Stories
- TikTok day-in-the-life
- Facebook album series
- Website "About" content

## Photography Workflow for Food Trucks

### Comprehensive Shoot Approach

For a full content library:

**Pre-market session (controlled environment):**
1. Clean and stage truck exterior
2. Hero shots of each menu item
3. Prep and cooking process shots
4. Team portraits/headshots
5. Detail shots of truck interior

**Market-day session (atmospheric):**
1. Arriving and setting up
2. First customers of the day
3. Golden hour crowd energy
4. Food in market context
5. Evening market glow
6. Pack-down (authenticity)

This combination provides versatile content for all marketing needs.

### DIY Quick-Shoot Process

For regular social content between professional shoots:

**Equipment:**
- Smartphone with good camera
- Portable reflector (or white foam board)
- Clean plate/surface for hero shots
- Phone tripod/grip

**Steps:**
1. Find the best light source (window, shade)
2. Clear clutter from background
3. Style dish simply
4. Take 10-20 shots varying angle
5. Edit quickly in Lightroom Mobile
6. Post same day

### Working with Professional Photographers

**Expect to provide:**

## Social Media Strategy for Food Trucks

### Platform Priorities

| Platform | Priority | Content Type |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Instagram** | High | Hero food, truck exterior, atmosphere |
| **TikTok** | High | Behind-scenes, cooking process, POV |
| **Facebook** | Medium | Event announcements, menu photos |
| **Google Business** | Essential | Menu items, truck exterior |

### Content That Performs

**High engagement posts:**
- Before/after cooking transformation
- Steam/sizzle action videos

- Queue time-lapse
- Customer reactions

**Story content:**
- Day-in-the-life sequences

### Photo Specifications

- Warm, appetising colour grade
- Consistent filter/preset

**Instagram Stories:**
- 1080 x 1920px (9:16)
- Text overlays for announcements
- Location tags always

**TikTok/Reels:**

- First 3 seconds critical
- Trending audio when appropriate

**Menu boards:**

- Minimal text overlay (add separately)

## Lighting Challenges at Perth Markets

### Bright Summer Sun (Problem)

Perth's intense summer sun creates:
- Harsh shadows on food
- Washed-out colours
- Squinting staff in photos
- Unflattering overhead light

**Solutions:**
- Shoot under truck awning
- Use shadow side of truck
- Wait for cloud cover moments
- Position reflector for fill light
- Shoot in morning before intensity peaks

### Golden Hour (Opportunity)

Perth summer evenings (5-7pm) offer perfect conditions:
- Warm, golden skin tones
- Beautiful backlight possibilities
- Active market atmosphere
- Soft, flattering food light

**Capture during this window:**
- Wide shots with sunset backdrop
- Backlit customer moments
- The truck glowing against warm sky
- String light sparkle starting

### Evening Markets (Challenge + Reward)

After sunset brings mixed conditions:

**Challenges:**
- Low light requiring high ISO
- Mixed artificial lighting colours
- Fast movement blur risk

**Rewards:**
- Atmospheric string light bokeh
- Moody, appetising food images
- Unique evening market vibe
- Fewer harsh shadows

**Solutions:**
- Use fast lenses (f/1.4-f/2.8)
- Embrace warm artificial tones
- Add portable LED for detail
- Accept some motion blur (adds energy)

## Branding Consistency Across Markets

### Creating Recognisable Content

Your photos should be identifiable across any platform:

**Visual consistency:**
- Colour palette in props/backgrounds
- Recurring brand elements visible
- Similar editing style (presets)
- Consistent composition approaches

**Content themes:**
- Always include truck somehow
- Signature dish featured regularly
- Team members recognisable
- Your unique "vibe" visible

### Photography Kit for Market Days

Keep a portable kit ready:

**Essentials:**
- Clean backdrop (branded vinyl mat works)
- Favourite props in brand colours
- Phone tripod/grip
- White reflector card
- Cleaning supplies for dishes

**Nice to have:**
- Portable LED light
- Second phone for video
- Printed shot list reminder
- Backup charger

## Menu Board Photography

### Creating Effective Menu Images

Your menu board is prime marketing space:

**Requirements:**
- High resolution (prints clearly)
- Clean, uncluttered backgrounds
- Consistent style across items
- Generous-looking portions
- Accurate colour representation

**Avoid:**
- Complex backgrounds
- Images that differ drastically from actual serving
- Poor lighting creating grey/dull colours
- Overcrowded frames

### Digital Menu Integration

For ordering apps and tablets:

**Specifications:**
