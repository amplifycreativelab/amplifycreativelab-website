<p>
  If you're a Perth restaurant, café or bar owner looking to build or rebuild your website, one of the first questions you'll ask is “How much will this cost?” The answer isn't a single number—it depends on whether you need a simple online menu, a full booking system, integrated photography, and how much you value speed, SEO and long‑term flexibility.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Direct answer:</strong> A professional, custom‑coded restaurant website in Perth typically ranges from <strong>$3,000 to $12,000+</strong> in 2025. DIY platforms (Wix, Squarespace) can start as low as $300‑$800 per year, but often lack the performance, local SEO optimisation and mobile‑first design that drive actual bookings.
</p>

<h2>Why Restaurant Websites Are a Different Beast</h2>

<p>
  A hospitality website isn't just a digital brochure—it's your 24/7 front‑of‑house. It needs to load instantly on mobile, show your menu without pinching (see our guide on <a href="/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo/">why PDF menus hurt your SEO</a>), integrate with your booking system, and make hungry visitors want to click “Book a table”. That requires a blend of design, photography and technical performance that generic templates rarely deliver.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data hook:</strong> According to Google, <strong>53% of mobile visitors will leave a site that takes longer than three seconds to load</strong>. If your website is slow, you're literally turning away half your potential customers before they even see your menu.

</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Cost Ranges</h2>

<p>
  To help you understand what you're paying for, here’s a realistic breakdown of website cost tiers for Perth venues in 2025.
</p>

<h3>Tier 1: DIY Builder (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Cost:</strong> $300 – $800 per year (hosting + subscription) + your time.<br />
  <strong>What you get:</strong> A templated site you can edit yourself, often with drag‑and‑drop builders. Suitable for very small cafés or pop‑ups that don't need advanced SEO or custom functionality.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The catch:</strong> These platforms are notorious for <strong>bloated code</strong> that slows down pages, hurting your Google ranking and mobile experience. They also lock you into their ecosystem—if you want to move later, you often have to rebuild from scratch.
</p>

<h3>Tier 2: Theme‑Based WordPress Site</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Cost:</strong> $1,500 – $4,000 one‑off + $200‑$500/year hosting.<br />
  <strong>What you get:</strong> A more flexible site built on WordPress with a pre‑made restaurant theme. Can include basic booking plugins, menu displays and gallery sliders.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The catch:</strong> Many WordPress themes are overloaded with features you'll never use, which again drags down speed. Security and plugin updates become your responsibility, and if the theme isn't coded with Perth's mobile‑first users in mind, you could still lose bookings to faster competitors.
</p>

<h3>Tier 3: Custom‑Coded, Performance‑Optimised Site</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Cost:</strong> $3,000 – $8,000+ one‑off + $300‑$600/year hosting.<br />
  <strong>What you get:</strong> A website built from the ground up for your venue, using modern frameworks like Astro or Next.js. Every line of code is written to be fast, SEO‑friendly and perfectly aligned with your brand. Includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile‑first responsive design that works on any device.</li>
  <li>Integrated menu system (no PDFs).</li>
  <li>Core Web Vitals optimisation (fast loading, no layout shifts).</li>
  <li>Local SEO setup (Google Business Profile, schema markup).</li>
  <li>Professional food photography integration (images sized and compressed for speed).</li>
  <li>Booking system connections (ResDiary, Quandoo, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is the tier we recommend for most established Perth restaurants, because it turns your website from a cost centre into a booking engine.
</p>

<h3>Tier 4: Full‑Service Web + Photography Package</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Cost:</strong> $6,000 – $12,000+ one‑off.<br />
  <strong>What you get:</strong> Everything in Tier 3, plus a dedicated half‑ or full‑day food photography shoot, professional packshots of your venue, and a complete visual library for your website, social media and delivery platforms.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> When the same team handles both the photography and the code, images are optimised for web performance from the start—no extra compression steps, no mismatched colours, no waiting for files from a separate photographer. The result is a website that looks stunning <em>and</em> loads in under two seconds.
</p>

<h2>What Drives the Price Up (or Down)</h2>

<p>
  Several factors can push your website quote toward the higher or lower end of these ranges:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Number of pages:</strong> A simple one‑page menu site costs less than a multi‑venue site with separate event, gallery and blog sections.</li>
  <li><strong>Booking & payment integrations:</strong> Connecting to ResDiary, Quandoo or Stripe adds complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>E‑commerce:</strong> Selling merchandise, gift vouchers or take‑away meals requires secure payment gateways and inventory management.</li>
  <li><strong>Content creation:</strong> If you need copywriting, professional photography or video, that's an additional investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> Some agencies include monthly updates, security monitoring and performance checks; others hand over the site and let you manage it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Hidden Cost of a Cheap Website</h2>

<p>
  Choosing the lowest‑price option often means sacrificing the very things that make a restaurant website effective:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Slow load times</strong> → higher bounce rates, fewer bookings.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor mobile experience</strong> → frustrated customers on phones.</li>
  <li><strong>Weak local SEO</strong> → you don't appear in “restaurant Perth” searches.</li>
  <li><strong>Generic photography</strong> → your food looks the same as every other venue.</li>
  <li><strong>No ongoing support</strong> → when something breaks, you're stuck.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In other words, a cheap website can cost you more in lost revenue than you save upfront.
</p>

<h2>How to Get an Accurate Quote for Your Venue</h2>

<p>
  The best way to know what your website will cost is to provide potential developers with a clear brief. Before you reach out, think about:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your primary goal (more bookings, better menu presentation, online orders).</li>
  <li>Must‑have features (booking system, menu with filters, gallery, blog).</li>
  <li>Your existing visual assets (do you have professional photos, or will you need a shoot?).</li>
  <li>Your timeline and budget range.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Then, ask for a detailed proposal that breaks down design, development, photography and ongoing costs. A reputable agency will be transparent about what's included and why each item matters for your bottom line.
</p>
