faq:
  - question: "How much do corporate headshots cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Costs vary by volume. For a solo shoot, expect $250-$450. For teams, day rates apply (approx $1,500-$2,500) covering 10-30 staff members. This includes lighting setup, portable studio, and retouching."
  - question: "Studio background or environmental?"
    answer: "Studio (plain background) is versatile, clean, and easy to match for future hires. Environmental (in your office/venue) is more modern, approachable, and tells a brand story. We recommend environmental for creative industries and hospitality."
  - question: "What should we wear?"
    answer: "Avoid fine patterns (which cause moiré effect) and neon colours. Solid, mid-tone colours work best. Most importantly: wear clothes that fit well. We provide a full style guide upon booking."
  - question: "How long does it take per person?"
    answer: "For volume headshots, allow 10-15 minutes per person. This gives time to fix hair, build rapport, and get genuine expressions. Rushing leads to 'deer in headlights' looks."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First Impressions:</strong> Your 'About Us' page is often the second most visited page on your site. Don't hide behind stock photos.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Team photos should look cohesive. Same lighting, same background, same vibe.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental style:</strong> Using your Perth office or venue as a backdrop builds trust and shows context.</li>
    <li><strong>Retouching:</strong> Professional retouching should look natural—removing temporary blemishes (pimples) but keeping permanent features (smile lines).</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

In the digital age, people still buy from people. Whether you run a law firm on St Georges Terrace, a creative agency in Northbridge, or a hospitality group in Fremantle, putting faces to your brand builds trust.

But not all "headshots" are created equal. The stiff, grey-background school-photo style is out. Authentic, engaging corporate portraiture is in.

## Studio vs. Environmental: Choosing Your Style

### Studio Headshots
*   **The Look:** Clean, solid colou background (White, Grey, Black, or Brand Colour).
*   **Pros:** deeply consistent; easy to replicate for new staff later; focuses 100% on the face.
*   **Best for:** Large corporate teams, LinkedIn profiles, directory listings.

### Environmental Portraits
*   **The Look:** Taken in your workspace, venue, or an outdoor Perth location, with the background blurred (shallow depth of field).
*   **Pros:** Tells a story; feels modern and approachable; shows off your office/venue culture.
*   **Best for:** Creative agencies, hospitality (chefs in kitchen), architects, leadership teams.

## Preparing Your Team

Most people hate having their photo taken. It's our job to make them comfortable, but preparation helps:

1.  **The Schedule:** create a timetable. Don't make staff wait around for an hour.
2.  **The Mirror Check:** Provide a full-length mirror near the staging area for last-minute checks (teeth, hair, collars).
3.  **The Brief:** Tell staff *why* we are doing this. "We want to show our clients how friendly and professional we are."

## Beyond The Headshot: Interaction Shots

While we have the lights set up, we recommend capturing "B-Roll" of your team working.
*   Meeting room collaboration.
*   Coffee machine chats.
*   Sketching/planning sessions.

These images are gold for your careers page, annual reports, and social media content.
