faq:
  - question: "Should we respond to every review?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Google has explicitly stated that responding to reviews improves your local SEO. It shows you are active. Responding to positive reviews builds loyalty; responding to negative ones shows you care about service recovery."
  - question: "Can we delete a bad review on Google?"
    answer: "Generally, no. Google only removes reviews that violate their content policy (hate speech, conflict of interest, spam). You can't remove a review just because you disagree with the customer's opinion. The best defense is to bury it with new, positive reviews."
  - question: "Is it okay to offer a free coffee for a review?"
    answer: "Technically, Google's policy forbids 'incentivised' reviews. You shouldn't say 'Give us 5 stars and get a free coffee.' However, you can simply encourage honest feedback. A better approach is using a QR code on the table that says 'Loved your meal? Let us know!' linking to your profile."
  - question: "How fast should we respond?"
    answer: "Aim for 24-48 hours. A prompt response shows you are attentive. Letting a negative review sit unanswered for weeks looks like negligence."
  - question: "How do reviews affect our Google ranking?"
    answer: "Review signals (Review quantity, velocity, and diversity) make up about 15% of how Google decides which businesses to show in the 'Local Pack' (top 3 map results). More reviews + frequent reviews = better visibility."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volume & Velocity:</strong> Getting 5 reviews this week is better than getting 50 reviews a year ago. Consistent fresh feedback matters most.</li>
    <li><strong>Keywords in Responses:</strong> When you reply, use keywords. 'Thanks for trying our <em>vegan burger</em>' helps Google associate your business with that term.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Argue:</strong> Never get into a fight in the comments. It makes you look defensive and unprofessional to future customers. Chill first, type later.</li>
    <li><strong>The 'Service Recovery' Paradox:</strong> Customers who have a problem fixed quickly often become more loyal than those who never had a problem at all.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

In 2025, your potential customers are looking at your stars before they look at your menu. 93% of consumers say online reviews influence their purchase decisions.

For Perth restaurants and cafes, your Google Business Profile (and its review count) is your most important digital asset—more important than your Instagram, significantly more important than your Facebook page.

Review management isn't just about ego; it's a critical Local SEO strategy.

## The 3 Pillars of Review Strategy

### 1. Acquisition (Asking for it)
Most happy customers forget to leave a review. Unhappy ones remember. You need to bridge that gap.
*   **QR Codes on tables:** "Scan to leave feedback" (direct link to the Google Review form, pre-filled with 5 stars if possible via link tools).
*   **The Payment Moment:** Train staff to say, "If you enjoyed that, we'd love a review on Google."
*   **Email Follow-up:** If you have a booking system (OpenTable, SevenRooms), automate an email 2 hours after their reservation.

### 2. Monitoring (Listening)
You need to know when reviews happen.
*   Set up Google Alerts or use the Google Maps app to get push notifications instantly.
*   Monitor TripAdvisor (still relevant for tourists) and Facebook recommendations.

### 3. Response (Engaging)
This is where the magic happens. Your response is public marketing.

## The "Perfect Response" Framework

### Responding to GOOD Reviews (The SEO Boost)
Don't just say "Thanks." Use the opportunity to reinforce keywords.

*   *Customer:* "Loved the food!"
*   *Bad Reply:* "Thanks!"
*   *Good Reply:* "Thanks Sarah! So glad you enjoyed our **signature wood-fired pizza**. We hope to see you back in **Leederville** soon!"
    *   *Why:* You just told Google you serve wood-fired pizza in Leederville.

### Responding to BAD Reviews (Damage Control)
The goal isn't to win the argument; it's to show *future* customers that you are reasonable and professional.

**The "HEARD" Method:**
*   **H**ear: Acknowledge the specific complaint.
*   **E**mpathise: "We are so sorry your experience didn't meet our standards."
*   **A**pologise: Say sorry, even if you think they are wrong.
*   **R**esolve: "We have addressed this with the kitchen team."
*   **D**irect: Take it offline. "Please email us at manager@venue.com so we can make this right."

**Never:**
*   Call the customer a liar.
*   Blame the customer.
*   Write a 500-word essay defending yourself.

## Reviews and Local SEO

Google loves data. Reviews provide user-generated content that tells Google what your business is about.

*   **Attribute extraction:** If 10 people mention "Best coffee in Perth" in their reviews, Google starts associating your business strongly with that phrase. You will rank higher for "Best coffee Perth."
*   **Freshness:** A steady stream of new reviews signals that the business is open, popular, and trustworthy.

## Dealing with Fake/Spam Reviews

It happens. A 1-star review with no text from a profile called "PlayerOne123".
*   **Flag it:** Use the "Flag as inappropriate" tool in Google Business Profile.
*   **Reason:** Select "Spam and fake content."
*   **Respond anyway:** "Hi, we don't have a record of your visit. We take all feedback seriously—could you please provide more details so we can verify this?" (This shows genuine customers that this review is likely fake).
