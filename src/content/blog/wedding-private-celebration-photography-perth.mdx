faq:
  - question: "What is 'Documentary Style' wedding photography?"
    answer: "Documentary (or reportage) style means we capture the day as it unfolds naturally, without interfering or directing. We don't stop you to say 'look here and smile'. We hunt for the real smiles, the teary hugs, and the crazy dance floor moves. The result is a gallery that feels like a true story, not a photoshoot."
  - question: "Do you cover small, intimate elopements?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We love them. Whether it's a registry office signing or a pop-up ceremony on a Cottesloe beach, intimate weddings often allow for the most creative and emotional intimacy in photos. We have hourly packages specifically for these shorter events."
  - question: "How far in advance should we book?"
    answer: "For Saturday weddings in peak season (September to April), we recommend booking 12-18 months in advance. For engagement parties or birthday celebrations, 3-6 months is usually sufficient."
  - question: "Do you offer engagement shoots?"
    answer: "Yes, and we highly recommend them. An engagement shoot is a 'practice run' that helps you get comfortable in front of the camera before the big day. Plus, you get beautiful images to use for your 'Save the Date' cards."
  - question: "What happens if it rains?"
    answer: "We embrace it! Overcast skies act as a giant soft-box creating flattering light, and rain can be incredibly romantic. We always have a backup plan for locations and come prepared with clear umbrellas and weather-sealed equipment."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chemistry is key:</strong> Your photographer is the 'guest' who stays by your side all day. Make sure you actually like them as a person!</li>
    <li><strong>Light drives the schedule:</strong> Plan your ceremony and portraits around 'Golden Hour' (the hour before sunset) for the best possible photos.</li>
    <li><strong>Unplugged works bets:</strong> Asking guests to put phones away during the ceremony ensures your professional photos aren't blocked by a sea of iPads.</li>
    <li><strong>The 'In-Between' moments:</strong> The best photo isn't usually the kiss; it's the nervous hand-squeeze right before it.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Your life is punctuated by moments that deserve more than a smartphone selfie. Whether it's saying "I do" in the Swan Valley, celebrating 50 years of marriage, or throwing an engagement party in a Fremantle warehouse, these are the days you'll want to look back on forever.

At Amplify Creative Lab, we believe that the best event photography isn't about perfect poses; it's about perfect *feelings*.

## The Shift to Candid Authenticity

Gone are the days of stiff, formal line-ups that take hours. Modern Perth couples and families are prioritising **Experience over Posing**.

You want to enjoy your party. You want to drink the champagne, hug your friends, and dance. You don't want to spend 2 hours standing in a line smiling at a lens.

Our approach is **80% Documentary, 20% Directed**.
*   **Documentary:** We blend into the crowd, capturing the laughter, the tears, and the chaos as it happens.
*   **Directed:** When the light is perfect, we steal you away for 15 minutes to create some epic, cinematic portraits that look natural but are carefully crafted.

## Weddings & Elopements

Perth offers stunning backdrops, and we know how to use them.
*   **Swan Valley:** Vines, rustic rich earth tones, and golden sunsets.
*   **Coastal (Cottesloe/Scarborough):** Blue horizons, white sands, and soft, breezy light.
*   **Urban (CBD/Northbridge):** Heritage brick, street art, and dramatic architectural lines.

Whether you have 200 guests at the Crown Towers or 10 guests in a backyard, the story remains the same: Two people committing to each other. We focus on the connection between you, not just the dress or the flowers (though we shoot those too!).

## Engagement Parties

Think of this as the "Season Opener" for your wedding. It's often the first time both families are in a room together. It's high energy, usually less formal than the wedding, and full of anticipation.

**Why hire a pro?**
So you can actually host. If you are taking photos, you aren't talking to your guests. Let us capture the speeches and the candids so you can be present.

## Milestone Birthdays (21st, 40th, 50th, 60th)

These events are rare gatherings of all your favourite people.
*   **The 21st:** High energy, glamour, speeches from proud parents. We focus on the 'glam' shots and the dancefloor action.
*   **The 50th/60th:** Often about legacy. We ensure we get beautiful portraits of generations together—grandparents with grandkids—which become family heirlooms.

## Tips for Better Event Photos

1.  **Lighting:** If you are hosting an evening event, amber 'mood' lighting is better than coloured DJ lasers (which put green dots on faces).
2.  **Tidiness:** In the getting-ready room, hide the suitcases and plastic bags. A clean room makes for elegant photos.
3.  **Trust:** If we suggest moving to a different spot for a photo, trust us. We are chasing the good light!
