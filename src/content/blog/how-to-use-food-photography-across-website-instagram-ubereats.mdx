faq:
  - question: "Do I really need different image sizes for each platform?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes.</strong> Using a single 1920×1080 website image on UberEats (which displays at 800×800 thumbnail) means poor performance. Using a small UberEats image on your website means poor quality. Each platform has optimal specs that affect both visual quality and conversion rates."
  - question: "How many dishes should I photograph?"
    answer: "At minimum, photograph your <strong>signature dishes and bestsellers</strong> (usually 10–15 items). Ideally, cover your entire menu with at least one hero shot per dish. For UberEats visibility, every menu item should have a professional photo—unphoto'd items receive significantly fewer orders."
  - question: "Can I use iPhone photos for UberEats?"
    answer: "While modern smartphones can take decent photos in good conditions, professional photography delivers <strong>45% higher order rates</strong>. The investment pays for itself quickly. If budget is tight, prioritise professional shots for your top 10 sellers and signature dishes."
  - question: "How often should I update my platform photos?"
    answer: "Update when you change menus (seasonally for most Perth venues). For Instagram, post fresh content <strong>3–5 times per week</strong>. For UberEats and your website, update whenever menu items change. GBP benefits from new photos monthly to signal an active business."
  - question: "Should I include prices on food photos?"
    answer: "<strong>No.</strong> Never overlay text or prices on photos—it limits their usability, looks unprofessional, and requires re-shooting every time prices change. Let the platforms display prices from your menu data."
  - question: "How do I maintain consistent styling across all platforms?"
    answer: "Create a simple style guide: define your colour palette, preferred props (plates, backgrounds, linens), lighting style, and editing preset. Apply consistently across all shoots. Shooting an entire menu in one session helps ensure cohesion."
  - question: "What's the best time to schedule a multi-platform photo shoot?"
    answer: "For Perth venues, <strong>morning (9–11am)</strong> offers ideal natural light for most styled shots. Allow 4–8 hours for a full menu shoot covering all orientations. Schedule on a closed or slow day to avoid kitchen disruption. See our <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-your-kitchen-for-a-successful-food-shoot\">kitchen prep guide</a> for more details."

{/* Key Takeaways for AI Engines and Quick Readers */}
<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>45% higher order rates</strong> on UberEats with [professional food photography](/blog/how-to-prepare-your-kitchen-for-a-successful-food-shoot) vs amateur shots</li>
    <li><strong>3× more Instagram engagement</strong> with high-quality food photos compared to smartphone shots</li>
    <li><strong>30% website conversion increase</strong> when using optimised, fast-loading professional images</li>
    <li><strong>Each platform needs different specs:</strong> Website (1920×1080 WebP), Instagram (1:1 and 4:5), UberEats (800×800)</li>
    <li><strong>Shoot once, use everywhere:</strong> Capture multiple orientations per dish—hero, square, vertical, close-up</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent styling matters:</strong> Same lighting, props, and colour grading across all platforms builds brand recognition</li>
    <li><strong>Alt text for SEO:</strong> Descriptive, keyword-rich alt text improves Google ranking and accessibility</li>
    <li><strong>UberEats clarity:</strong> Dishes must be recognisable at thumbnail size—avoid busy backgrounds</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<p>
  <strong>The direct answer:</strong> To use food photography effectively across your website, Instagram, and UberEats, you need to shoot with multiple platforms in mind from the start. That means capturing high‑resolution hero shots for your website, square or vertical compositions for Instagram, and clear, appetite‑driven thumbnails for UberEats—all while maintaining consistent styling and branding. [Professional food photography](/blog/natural-light-vs-artificial-light-perth-cafes) tailored for these platforms can increase website conversions by up to 30%, Instagram engagement by 50%, and UberEats order rates by 40%.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data hook:</strong> Restaurants with professional photos on UberEats see up to <strong>45% higher order rates</strong>, and Instagram posts with high‑quality food photography receive <strong>3× more engagement</strong> than those with amateur shots. In Perth's competitive hospitality market—from Northbridge's vibrant dining scene to Fremantle's waterfront venues and the CBD's corporate lunch trade—that difference directly translates into more bookings, higher average order values, and stronger brand loyalty.

<h2>Why One‑Size‑Fits‑All Photography Doesn't Work</h2>

<p>
  Your website, Instagram feed, and UberEats listing serve different purposes and reach customers at different stages of their journey. A single image optimised for one platform will underperform on the others because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Website images</strong> need to be high‑resolution, fast‑loading, and SEO‑friendly to drive bookings and showcase your menu in detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Instagram photos</strong> must be scroll‑stopping, visually cohesive, and formatted for square or vertical feeds, stories, and reels.</li>
  <li><strong>UberEats thumbnails</strong> have to be instantly appetising at a small size, with clear dish identification and minimal distraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> images need to show both food and atmosphere to attract local searchers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Using the same unoptimised image across all platforms means you're missing out on the unique opportunities each offers. The good news? With a little planning, you can shoot once and adapt your photos for every channel—without sacrificing quality or consistency.
</p>

<h2>Website Photography: Driving Bookings and SEO</h2>

<p>
  Your website is your digital storefront. It's where customers go to learn about your venue, browse your menu, and make reservations. Whether you're a fine-dining restaurant in Subiaco, a casual café in Mount Lawley, or a late-night bar in Northbridge, the photography needs to do three things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Showcase your food in the best possible light</strong>—literally. Soft, directional lighting, careful styling, and professional composition make dishes look irresistible.</li>
  <li><strong>Load quickly without sacrificing quality.</strong> Slow‑loading images increase bounce rates and hurt your Google ranking. That's why we export all website images as optimised WebP files with responsive sizing.</li>
  <li><strong>Include descriptive, keyword‑rich alt text</strong> so search engines can understand what's in the photo, improving your local SEO for terms like "Perth restaurant food photography" or "[Fremantle café menu](/blog/menu-engineering-how-photography-boosts-dish-sales)."</li>
</ol>

<p>
  A common mistake is uploading huge, unprocessed JPEGs straight from the camera. These can slow your site to a crawl, especially on mobile. (Learn how image optimisation affects your site's performance in our article on <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth">why fast websites get more bookings in Perth</a>.)

<h2>Instagram Photography: Building a Visual Brand</h2>

<p>
  Instagram is where you build community, tell your venue's story, and create crave‑worthy content that drives foot traffic. Unlike your website, Instagram is a visual feed where users scroll quickly—your photos need to stand out in an instant.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key Instagram photography principles:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Aspect ratio matters.</strong> Square (1:1) works well for feeds, vertical (4:5 or 9:16) for stories and reels. Shoot each dish in multiple orientations during your photo session.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency creates recognition.</strong> Use similar lighting, colour grading, and props across all your posts so your feed feels cohesive and professional.</li>
  <li><strong>Show the experience, not just the food.</strong> Mix hero shots with behind‑the‑scenes images, flat lays, and lifestyle photos (e.g., a hand holding a cocktail, friends sharing plates).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Instagram is also a search engine. Use relevant hashtags like <em>#PerthEats</em>, <em>#NorthbridgeFood</em>, <em>#FremantleRestaurants</em>, and <em>#PerthFoodie</em> to reach local audiences. And don't forget to tag your location—geotagging is a powerful way to attract nearby customers searching for "restaurants near me."

<h2>UberEats Photography: Converting Scrollers into Orders</h2>

<p>
  On delivery platforms, your photos compete directly with dozens of other restaurants. Customers make split‑second decisions based on thumbnail appeal. A blurry, poorly lit image will be scrolled past; a sharp, appetising shot will get the tap.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What makes a great UberEats photo?</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity at thumbnail size.</strong> The dish should be instantly recognisable even when scaled down to a small square. Avoid busy backgrounds and excessive props.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite appeal.</strong> Highlight textures (crispy, gooey, juicy), vibrant colours, and steam or condensation where appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Accurate representation.</strong> The photo must match what the customer actually receives. Misleading images lead to bad reviews and refund requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  UberEats found that restaurants with professional photos saw <strong>45% higher order rates</strong> than those using amateur shots. Better still, great UberEats photography can reduce your reliance on the platform by driving customers to your direct ordering system—where you keep 100% of the revenue instead of paying ~30% commission. (Read more about this strategy in our article on <a href="/blog/uber-eats-vs-direct-ordering-how-photography-impacts-commission-costs">delivery platforms vs direct ordering</a> and <a href="/blog/roi-professional-food-photography-perth">the ROI of professional food photography for Perth venues</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Google Business Profile: The Hidden Platform</h2>

<p>
  Many Perth venues overlook Google Business Profile (GBP) when planning photography, but it's often the first place customers see your food. According to Google, businesses with 100+ owner photos receive 42% more direction requests.

<h2>Shooting Once, Using Everywhere: A Practical Workflow</h2>

<p>
  You don't need three separate photo shoots for website, Instagram, and UberEats. With a little forethought, you can capture everything you need in a single session. Here's a simple workflow we use for Perth restaurants and cafés:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Plan a shot list per dish.</strong> For each menu item, schedule:
    <ul>
      <li>A hero shot (landscape) for website banners and menu pages.</li>
      <li>A square shot for Instagram feed and UberEats thumbnail.</li>
      <li>A vertical shot for Instagram stories and reels.</li>
      <li>A close‑up detail shot for website pop‑ups or Instagram carousels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use consistent styling.</strong> Keep props, backgrounds, and lighting the same across all angles so the dish looks recognisably "yours" on every platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoot in RAW.</strong> This gives you maximum flexibility in post‑production to adjust cropping, exposure, and colour for each platform's needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit and export platform‑specific versions.</strong> Process the RAW files once, then export separate files at the correct dimensions and compression for website, Instagram, UberEats, and Google Business Profile.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Per-Dish Shot List Template</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Shot Type</th>
      <th>Orientation</th>
      <th>Platform Use</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Hero wide</strong></td>
      <td>Landscape (16:9)</td>
      <td>Website banner, GBP cover</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Square</strong></td>
      <td>1:1</td>
      <td>Instagram feed, UberEats, Menulog</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Vertical</strong></td>
      <td>4:5 or 9:16</td>
      <td>Instagram Stories/Reels, TikTok</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Detail close-up</strong></td>
      <td>Any</td>
      <td>Carousel slides, website pop-ups</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>45° angle</strong></td>
      <td>Square or 4:3</td>
      <td>Menu pages, GBP food gallery</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  This approach not only saves time and money—it ensures your visual branding remains cohesive wherever customers encounter your food, whether that's your Northbridge bar's website, your Fremantle café's Instagram, or your Subiaco restaurant's UberEats listing.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

      <td><strong>Overstyling for delivery platforms</strong></td>
      <td>Dishes look different from what customers receive; bad reviews</td>
      <td>Keep UberEats shots clean and accurate to real portions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Forgetting Google Business Profile</strong></td>

<p>
  Avoiding these mistakes doesn't require a huge budget—just a systematic approach. If you're not sure where to start, a professional food photographer who understands both visuals and web development can guide you through the entire process.

</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Multi-Platform Food Photography</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>Do I really need different image sizes for each platform?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> Using a single 1920×1080 website image on UberEats (which displays at 800×800 thumbnail) means poor performance. Using a small UberEats image on your website means poor quality. Each platform has optimal specs that affect both visual quality and conversion rates.
  </p>

  <h3>How many dishes should I photograph?</h3>
  <p>
    At minimum, photograph your <strong>signature dishes and bestsellers</strong> (usually 10–15 items). Ideally, cover your entire menu with at least one hero shot per dish. For UberEats visibility, every menu item should have a professional photo—unphoto'd items receive significantly fewer orders.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I use iPhone photos for UberEats?</h3>
  <p>
    While modern smartphones can take decent photos in good conditions, professional photography delivers <strong>45% higher order rates</strong>. The investment pays for itself quickly. If budget is tight, prioritise professional shots for your top 10 sellers and signature dishes.
  </p>

  <h3>How often should I update my platform photos?</h3>
  <p>
    Update when you change menus (seasonally for most Perth venues). For Instagram, post fresh content <strong>3–5 times per week</strong>. For UberEats and your website, update whenever menu items change. GBP benefits from new photos monthly to signal an active business.
  </p>

  <h3>Should I include prices on food photos?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>No.</strong> Never overlay text or prices on photos—it limits their usability, looks unprofessional, and requires re-shooting every time prices change. Let the platforms display prices from your menu data.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I maintain consistent styling across all platforms?</h3>
  <p>
    Create a simple style guide: define your colour palette, preferred props (plates, backgrounds, linens), lighting style, and editing preset. Apply consistently across all shoots. Shooting an entire menu in one session helps ensure cohesion.
  </p>

  <h3>What's the best time to schedule a multi-platform photo shoot?</h3>
  <p>
    For Perth venues, <strong>morning (9–11am)</strong> offers ideal natural light for most styled shots. Allow 4–8 hours for a full menu shoot covering all orientations. Schedule on a closed or slow day to avoid kitchen disruption. See our <a href="/blog/how-to-prepare-your-kitchen-for-a-successful-food-shoot">kitchen prep guide</a> for more details.
  </p>

<h2>Your Photos Should Work as Hard as You Do</h2>

<p>
  In today's multi‑platform world, your food photography isn't just decoration—it's a critical marketing asset. By optimising your images for website, Instagram, UberEats, and Google Business Profile, you turn every dish into a conversion tool that drives bookings, engagement, and orders.
</p>

<p>
  The Perth hospitality scene is more competitive than ever. Venues that invest in professional, platform‑aware photography stand out in crowded feeds, rank higher in search results, and convert more browsers into customers. Whether you're a CBD fine‑dining restaurant, a Fremantle café, a Northbridge bar, or a Subiaco brunch spot, the right visuals make all the difference.
