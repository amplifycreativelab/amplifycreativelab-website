<p>
  <strong>The direct answer:</strong> To use food photography effectively across your website, Instagram, and UberEats, you need to shoot with multiple platforms in mind from the start. That means capturing high‑resolution hero shots for your website, square or vertical compositions for Instagram, and clear, appetite‑driven thumbnails for UberEats—all while maintaining consistent styling and branding. Professional food photography tailored for these platforms can increase website conversions by up to 30%, Instagram engagement by 50%, and UberEats order rates by 40%.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data hook:</strong> Restaurants with professional photos on UberEats see up to <strong>45% higher order rates</strong>, and Instagram posts with high‑quality food photography receive <strong>3× more engagement</strong> than those with amateur shots. In Perth’s competitive hospitality market, that difference directly translates into more bookings, higher average order values, and stronger brand loyalty.
</p>

<h2>Why One‑Size‑Fits‑All Photography Doesn’t Work</h2>

<p>
  Your website, Instagram feed, and UberEats listing serve different purposes and reach customers at different stages of their journey. A single image optimised for one platform will underperform on the others because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Website images</strong> need to be high‑resolution, fast‑loading, and SEO‑friendly to drive bookings and showcase your menu in detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Instagram photos</strong> must be scroll‑stopping, visually cohesive, and formatted for square or vertical feeds, stories, and reels.</li>
  <li><strong>UberEats thumbnails</strong> have to be instantly appetising at a small size, with clear dish identification and minimal distraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Using the same unoptimised image across all three platforms means you’re missing out on the unique opportunities each offers. The good news? With a little planning, you can shoot once and adapt your photos for every channel—without sacrificing quality or consistency.
</p>

<h2>Website Photography: Driving Bookings and SEO</h2>

<p>
  Your website is your digital storefront. It’s where customers go to learn about your venue, browse your menu, and make reservations. The photography here needs to do three things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Showcase your food in the best possible light</strong>—literally. Soft, directional lighting, careful styling, and professional composition make dishes look irresistible.</li>
  <li><strong>Load quickly without sacrificing quality.</strong> Slow‑loading images increase bounce rates and hurt your Google ranking. That’s why we export all website images as optimised WebP files with responsive sizing.</li>
  <li><strong>Include descriptive, keyword‑rich alt text</strong> so search engines can understand what’s in the photo, improving your local SEO for terms like “Perth restaurant food photography” or “Fremantle café menu.”</li>
</ol>

<p>
  A common mistake is uploading huge, unprocessed JPEGs straight from the camera. These can slow your site to a crawl, especially on mobile. (Learn how image optimisation affects your site’s performance in our article on <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth">why fast websites get more bookings in Perth</a>.)
</p>

<h3>Website Image Specifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hero images:</strong> 1920 × 1080px (landscape), WebP format, ≤200 KB.</li>
  <li><strong>Menu/gallery images:</strong> 800 × 600px (portrait or landscape), WebP, ≤100 KB.</li>
  <li><strong>Alt text:</strong> Descriptive, include location and dish name (e.g., “Crispy pork belly with asian greens at a Northbridge restaurant”).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instagram Photography: Building a Visual Brand</h2>

<p>
  Instagram is where you build community, tell your venue’s story, and create crave‑worthy content that drives foot traffic. Unlike your website, Instagram is a visual feed where users scroll quickly—your photos need to stand out in an instant.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Key Instagram photography principles:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Aspect ratio matters.</strong> Square (1:1) works well for feeds, vertical (4:5 or 9:16) for stories and reels. Shoot each dish in multiple orientations during your photo session.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency creates recognition.</strong> Use similar lighting, colour grading, and props across all your posts so your feed feels cohesive and professional.</li>
  <li><strong>Show the experience, not just the food.</strong> Mix hero shots with behind‑the‑scenes images, flat lays, and lifestyle photos (e.g., a hand holding a cocktail, friends sharing plates).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Remember, Instagram is also a search engine. Use relevant hashtags like <em>#PerthFoodPhotography</em>, <em>#PerthCafes</em>, and <em>#FoodPhotographyTips</em> to reach local audiences. And don’t forget to tag your location—geotagging is a powerful way to attract nearby customers.
</p>

<h2>UberEats Photography: Converting Scrollers into Orders</h2>

<p>
  On delivery platforms, your photos compete directly with dozens of other restaurants. Customers make split‑second decisions based on thumbnail appeal. A blurry, poorly lit image will be scrolled past; a sharp, appetising shot will get the tap.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What makes a great UberEats photo?</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity at thumbnail size.</strong> The dish should be instantly recognisable even when scaled down to a small square. Avoid busy backgrounds and excessive props.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite appeal.</strong> Highlight textures (crispy, gooey, juicy), vibrant colours, and steam or condensation where appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Accurate representation.</strong> The photo must match what the customer actually receives. Misleading images lead to bad reviews and refunds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  UberEats has specific technical requirements (typically 800 × 800px, JPEG or PNG, under 5 MB), but the real differentiator is professional styling and lighting. A study by UberEats found that restaurants with professional photos saw <strong>45% higher order rates</strong> than those using amateur shots.
</p>

<p>
  Better still, great UberEats photography can reduce your reliance on the platform by driving customers to your direct ordering system—where you keep 100% of the revenue instead of paying ~30% commission.

</p>

<h2>Shooting Once, Using Everywhere: A Practical Workflow</h2>

<p>
  You don’t need three separate photo shoots for website, Instagram, and UberEats. With a little forethought, you can capture everything you need in a single session. Here’s a simple workflow we use for Perth restaurants and cafés:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Plan a shot list per dish.</strong> For each menu item, schedule:
    <ul>
      <li>A hero shot (landscape) for website banners and menu pages.</li>
      <li>A square shot for Instagram feed and UberEats thumbnail.</li>
      <li>A vertical shot for Instagram stories and reels.</li>
      <li>A close‑up detail shot for website pop‑ups or Instagram carousels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use consistent styling.</strong> Keep props, backgrounds, and lighting the same across all angles so the dish looks recognisably “yours” on every platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Shoot in RAW.</strong> This gives you maximum flexibility in post‑production to adjust cropping, exposure, and colour for each platform’s needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit and export platform‑specific versions.</strong> Process the RAW files once, then export separate files at the correct dimensions and compression for website, Instagram, and UberEats.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This approach not only saves time and money—it ensures your visual branding remains cohesive wherever customers encounter your food.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

<p>
  Even venues with good intentions often stumble on these pitfalls:

      <td>Create platform‑specific versions from your master RAW files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Ignoring mobile optimisation</strong></td>
      <td>Slow loading, broken layouts on smartphones (where most customers browse)</td>
      <td>Test images on actual devices; use responsive image techniques</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Inconsistent styling across platforms</strong></td>
      <td>Confuses brand identity; makes your venue look unprofessional</td>
      <td>Develop a style guide and stick to it for every shoot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Neglecting alt text and file names</strong></td>
      <td>Missed SEO opportunities; poor accessibility for visually impaired users</td>
      <td>Write descriptive, keyword‑rich alt text and use meaningful file names (e.g., <code>crispy‑pork‑belly‑northbridge‑restaurant.webp</code>)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Avoiding these mistakes doesn’t require a huge budget—just a systematic approach. If you’re not sure where to start, a professional food photographer who understands both visuals and web development can guide you through the entire process.
</p>

<h2>Your Photos Should Work as Hard as You Do</h2>

<p>
  In today’s multi‑platform world, your food photography isn’t just decoration—it’s a critical marketing asset. By optimising your images for website, Instagram, and UberEats, you turn every dish into a conversion tool that drives bookings, engagement, and orders.
</p>

<p>
  The Perth hospitality scene is more competitive than ever. Venues that invest in professional, platform‑aware photography stand out in crowded feeds, rank higher in search results, and convert more browsers into customers. Whether you’re a CBD fine‑dining restaurant, a Fremantle café, or a Northbridge bar, the right visuals make all the difference.
