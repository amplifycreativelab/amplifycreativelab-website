  </ul>

<p>
  In today's digital-first dining world, your food photography is often the very
  first impression a potential guest has of your restaurant. A single image can
  be the difference between someone scrolling past or stopping to make a
  booking.
</p>

<p>
  As Perth-based food photographers, we've seen how the right images can lift a
  menu, strengthen a brand and increase both bookings and average spend. Here
  are five practical tips you can apply to your next shoot—whether you're
  working with a professional photographer or creating content in-house.
</p>

<h2>1. Use Soft, Directional Light</h2>
<p>
  Harsh overhead lighting will flatten your dishes and create unflattering
  shadows. Whenever possible, shoot near a large window with soft, natural light
  coming from the side or at a 45° angle to the plate. This gives your food
  depth, texture and that "I want to eat this now" feeling.
</p>
<p>
  If you're shooting at night, ask your photographer to bring softboxes or
  diffused continuous lights. The goal is the same: soft, even light that wraps
  around the food rather than blasting it.
</p>

<h2>2. Style for the Camera, Not Just the Table</h2>
<p>
  A plate that looks generous in person can look crowded on camera. Leave a
  little extra negative space on the plate, wipe the rim carefully and keep
  garnishes intentional. Think of every element as part of the story you're
  telling about the dish.
</p>
<p>
  Props matter too: textured linens, real cutlery, glassware and ingredients
  from the recipe (herbs, citrus, spices) can create context without distracting
  from the hero—the food itself.
</p>

<h2>3. Capture Dishes in Their Natural Habitat</h2>
<p>
  For restaurants, the environment is part of what you're selling. Mix close-up
  hero shots with wider frames that show the dish in context—on a table with
  drinks, in the hand of a server, or surrounded by friends sharing plates.
</p>
<p>
  These lifestyle images are perfect for social media and website hero sections
  because they help people imagine themselves in your venue.
</p>

<h2>4. Plan a Shot List Around Your Menu Goals</h2>
<p>
  Before shoot day, decide which dishes you most want to promote—your signature
  plates, high-margin items or new seasonal dishes. Build a simple shot list so
  nothing important gets missed and you can move efficiently through the
  session.
</p>
<p>
  Group similar dishes together (pasta, seafood, desserts) so styling, props and
  lighting setups can be reused. This saves time and keeps your visual story
  consistent.
</p>

<h2>5. Think Beyond the Single Image</h2>
<p>
  Rather than aiming for just one "hero" shot per dish, plan for variations:
  horizontal and vertical crops, close-ups and wider frames, clean menu shots
  and more atmospheric social media images. This gives your marketing team
  flexibility across website, delivery platforms, email and socials.
</p>

<p>
  When you work with a photographer, ask for a mix of formats optimised for web,
  print and social. That way your investment in the shoot keeps paying off long
  after the plates are cleared.
</p>

<h2>Ready to Refresh Your Menu Photography?</h2>
<p>
  Beautiful food photography doesn't just make your menu look good—it makes it
  perform better. If you're a Perth restaurant, café or bar and your current
  images don't reflect the quality of what you serve, it might be time for an
  update.
