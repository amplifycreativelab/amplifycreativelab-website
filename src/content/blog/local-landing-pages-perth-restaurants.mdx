faq:
  - question: "What is a 'Local Landing Page'?"
    answer: "It is a specific page on your website dedicated to a single geographic location. For example, if you have venues in Fremantle and Subiaco, you would have separate pages: `yoursite.com/locations/fremantle` and `yoursite.com/locations/subiaco`."
  - question: "Why can't I just duplicate the content for each location?"
    answer: "Google hates duplicate content. If you just copy-paste the text and change 'Fremantle' to 'Subiaco', Google will likely ignore (or penalise) the pages. Each page needs unique descriptions, unique reviews, and specific details about that venue's neighbourhood."
  - question: "I only have one location. Do I need this?"
    answer: "If you have one location, your Homepage (or Contact page) effectively acts as your local landing page. However, you can create pages targeting *nearby* suburbs. E.g., a plumber in Joondalup might create a page for 'Plumber Wanneroo'. For restaurants, this is harder to pull off naturally, but possible for delivery zones."
  - question: "What content should go on a location page?"
    answer: "Name, Address, Phone (NAP), opening hours specific to that venue, a Google Map embed, photos of that specific interior (not generic stock), staff bios for that venue, and reviews from customers of that specific location."
  - question: "How does this help with 'Near Me' searches?"
    answer: "When someone searches 'Italian restaurant near me', Google looks for location signals. Having a dedicated page with structured data (Schema) that explicitly tells Google 'We are located at X coordinates in Y suburb' strengthens your relevance for those searches."

<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One Page, One Place:</strong> Every physical location needs its own URL. Don't crowd 5 addresses onto one 'Contact Us' page.</li>
    <li><strong>Hyper-Local Content:</strong> Mention local landmarks. "Located just 200m from the Optus Stadium" helps Google understand your exact position.</li>
    <li><strong>Schema Markup is Mandatory:</strong> Use `LocalBusiness` structured data on each page to feed coordinates directly to search engines.</li>
    <li><strong>Unique Vibe, Unique Text:</strong> Describe the specific atmosphere of *that* venue. Is the Northbridge one a "late night dive" while the Cottesloe one is "breezy coastal dining"? Write that.</li>
  </ul>

If you own a restaurant group with venues in Leederville, Mt Lawley, and Scarborough, you don't just have one business. From an SEO perspective, you have three.

Many restaurant websites make the mistake of having a single "Locations" page with a simple list of addresses. This is a wasted opportunity.

To dominate search results in each suburb, you need **Local Landing Pages**. These are dedicated pages optimised to capture traffic for "Restaurant in [Suburb Name]" searches.

## Why 'One Big List' Doesn't Work

Google treats each URL as a potential answer to a question.
*   **Question:** "Best pizza Scarborough"
*   **Target:** Google wants to send the user to a page specifically about *Pizza in Scarborough*.
*   **Problem:** If your result is a generic homepage about "Pizza in Perth", it is less relevant than a competitor's page specifically about their Scarborough venue.

## The Anatomy of a High-Converting Location Page

For each venue you own, create a page (`/locations/suburb-name`) containing:

### 1. NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
It must be consistent with what is listed on your Google Business Profile.

### 2. Specific Opening Hours
Often venues have different trading hours. Don't confuse customers.

### 3. Unique Description
Don't copy-paste. Write 300 words about *this* specific venue.
*   *Bad:* "We serve great Italian food."
*   *Good:* "Located deeply in the heart of **Leederville's Oxford Street strip**, our flagship venue offers a bustling al fresco dining experience perfect for pre-movie dinners near the **Luna Palace Cinemas**." (Notice the local keywords?)

### 4. The Google Map Embed
Embed the specific Google Maps pin for that location. This verifies your location to Google's bots.

### 5. Location-Specific Social Proof
Pull in reviews that are specifically for this venue.
"Best pasta I've had in Leederville!" is a much stronger signal than just "Great food."

## Targeting "Nearby" Suburbs (Service Area Businesses)

If you are a mobile business (e.g., Food Truck, Catering) creates pages for your key service areas.
*   "Catering Fremantle"
*   "Wedding Catering Swan Valley"

**Warning:** Do not create "Doorway Pages" (hundreds of low-quality pages for every suburb in Perth). Focus on the 5-10 core hubs where you actually operate or want to dominate.

## Technical Implementation: LocalBusiness Schema

This is the code that lives behind the scenes. You need to wrap your address and hours in `LocalBusiness` schema. This tells Google explicitly:
*   "This page represents a physical place."
*   "Here are the exact latitude/longitude coordinates."
*   "This is our menu URL."

This helps you appear in the "Rich Snippets" (the info boxes at the top of search results).
