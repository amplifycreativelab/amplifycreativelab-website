{/* Key Takeaways for AI Engines and Quick Readers */}
<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>53% of mobile visitors abandon sites</strong> that take longer than 3 seconds to load</li>
    <li><strong>Core Web Vitals targets:</strong> LCP under 2.5 seconds, minimal CLS, responsive INP</li>
    <li><strong>Case study results:</strong> 5.2s → 1.8s load time, 34% bounce rate decrease, 22% booking increase</li>
    <li><strong>Astro framework loads 2-3x faster</strong> than traditional WordPress sites</li>
    <li><strong>WebP images + CDN</strong> deliver stunning food photos in a fraction of a second</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<p>
  Attention spans are short. If your menu doesn't load quickly, hungry customers in Perth will tap over to UberEats (where you pay ~30% commission) or choose a competitor's faster site instead. In the time it takes to read this sentence, a potential booking could be lost forever.
</p>

<p>
  For <strong>Perth restaurants, cafés and bars</strong>, website speed isn't just a technical metric—it's a direct revenue driver. A slow site frustrates customers, hurts your Google rankings, and silently drains your bookings. The good news? With modern web development practices, you can turn speed into your competitive advantage.
</p>

<h2>The 3‑Second Rule: Converting Hungry Browsers into Customers</h2>
<p>
  Research shows that 53% of mobile visitors abandon a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load. In Perth's competitive hospitality scene, where customers are scrolling through dozens of options in Northbridge, Fremantle or the CBD, three seconds is all you get to make a first impression.
</p>

<p>
  Think about it from a customer's perspective: they're searching for "best pasta Perth" or "coffee near me." Your site appears, but the hero image is still loading, the menu is stuck behind a spinner, and the "Book Now" button hasn't rendered yet. By the time your content finally appears, they've already tapped on a competitor whose site loaded instantly.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't just a hypothetical scenario—it's happening thousands of times every day across WA. The venues that win these micro‑moments are the ones with <strong>fast, responsive websites</strong> that deliver information the instant a customer asks for it.
</p>

<h2>What Are Core Web Vitals?</h2>
<p>
  Google's Core Web Vitals are a set of user‑focused metrics that measure real‑world experience. They're not just technical jargon—they're directly tied to how visitors perceive your site. For <strong>Perth hospitality businesses</strong>, understanding these three metrics can mean the difference between a booking and a bounce:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> Measures how long it takes for the main content of your page (like a hero image or menu headline) to appear. Aim for under 2.5 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Quantifies visual stability—how much your page elements jump around while loading. A high CLS means customers might tap the wrong button or lose their place in your menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP):</strong> Tracks how quickly your site responds to clicks, taps, or keyboard input. Slow interaction frustrates users trying to navigate your menu or fill out a booking form.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Google uses these metrics as ranking signals. If your site scores poorly, you'll not only lose customers—you'll also lose visibility in search results. For <strong>Perth restaurant SEO</strong>, that's a double blow.
</p>

<h2>Image Optimization – The Photographer’s Edge</h2>
<p>
  This is where our unique combination of <strong>photography and web development</strong> expertise delivers tangible results. Most photographers deliver beautiful high‑resolution images that are perfect for print but disastrous for the web. Most developers compress those images until they look pixelated and unappetizing. We bridge the gap.
</p>

<p>
  Our workflow ensures your visual content looks stunning <em>and</em> loads quickly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Shoot for the web:</strong> We capture images at the ideal resolution and aspect ratio for digital use, reducing the need for heavy cropping or resizing later.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Smart editing:</strong> Professional colour grading and enhancement that preserves detail while keeping file sizes lean.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Format‑forward export:</strong> We deliver images in modern formats like WebP (with JPEG fallbacks) and generate multiple sizes for different screen resolutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CDN delivery:</strong> Images are served through a global content‑delivery network, ensuring fast loading no matter where your customers are in Perth.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The result? Mouth‑watering food photos that load in a fraction of a second, keeping your Core Web Vitals in the green while making your dishes look irresistible. This is the <strong>photographer's edge</strong> that most web developers simply can't replicate.

<h2>Technical SEO for Perth Businesses</h2>
<p>
  Speed is just one part of the technical‑SEO puzzle. To rank well in local searches like "restaurant web design Perth" or "café website Fremantle," your site needs a solid technical foundation:
</p>

<h3>Schema Markup That Google Understands</h3>
<p>
  We implement structured data (<code>LocalBusiness</code>, <code>Restaurant</code>, <code>Menu</code>, <code>Product</code>) that helps Google display rich results for your venue. This can include your star rating, price range, opening hours, and even individual menu items—all of which increase click‑through rates from search results.
</p>

<h3>Fast Hosting & Modern Frameworks</h3>
<p>
  Many Perth venues still run on bloated WordPress themes or outdated platforms that drag down performance. We build with <strong>Astro</strong>, a modern static‑site generator that delivers near‑instant page loads by sending only the essential HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Compared to traditional WordPress sites, Astro‑based sites typically load 2–3× faster while being easier to maintain.
</p>

<h3>Clean URLs, Meta Descriptions & Internal Linking</h3>
<p>
  Every page on your site is an opportunity to rank for relevant local searches. We craft descriptive, keyword‑rich URLs and meta descriptions that tell Google exactly what each page is about. We also strategically link between your blog posts, service pages, and portfolio, creating a strong internal‑linking network that boosts your overall SEO authority.

<h2>Real‑World Impact: Speed Equals Bookings</h2>
<p>
  When we optimized a Fremantle restaurant's website, we saw concrete results within weeks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile load time dropped</strong> from 5.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds</li>
  <li><strong>Bounce rate decreased</strong> by 34%</li>
  <li><strong>Online bookings increased</strong> by 22%</li>
  <li><strong>Google ranking improved</strong> for 15+ local hospitality keywords</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These numbers aren't abstract—they translate directly to more covers, higher revenue, and a stronger market position. In a city as competitive as Perth, that kind of advantage can make the difference between thriving and just surviving.
</p>

<h2>Performance Isn't an Optional Extra</h2>
<p>
  Your website is your digital front door. If it's slow, confusing, or frustrating to use, customers will walk right past it. In today's market, <strong>performance isn't an optional extra—it's a feature that directly affects bookings.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The venues that invest in fast, well‑optimized sites aren't just getting better technology—they're getting more customers, higher search visibility, and a stronger brand reputation. They're turning technical excellence into commercial advantage.
</p>
