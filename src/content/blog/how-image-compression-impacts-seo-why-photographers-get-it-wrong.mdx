faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?"
    answer: "<strong>Lossy compression</strong> removes some data to achieve smaller file sizes; <strong>lossless compression</strong> reduces file size without any data loss. For web photos, lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) is preferred because the quality loss is unnoticeable at 80–85% quality settings—and file sizes are dramatically smaller."
  - question: "How do I know if my images are too large?"
    answer: "Run your site through <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. If LCP is flagged as \"Poor\" (red) or \"Needs Improvement\" (orange), and the report mentions \"image optimization\" or \"properly size images,\" your images are likely too large. Our mini‑audit provides a detailed breakdown."
  - question: "Can I compress images after they're already on my website?"
    answer: "Yes. You can use tools like Squoosh, ImageOptim, or WordPress plugins (ShortPixel, Imagify) to compress existing images. However, for best results, it's better to re‑export from the original high‑resolution files with the correct dimensions and quality settings—you'll get better quality at smaller sizes."
  - question: "Do I need to use WebP if my site is built on WordPress?"
    answer: "WebP is strongly recommended but not mandatory. Many WordPress plugins (e.g., ShortPixel, Imagify) can automatically convert uploaded images to WebP and serve them to supported browsers with JPEG fallbacks. If you're on a custom Astro or Next.js site, we bake WebP conversion into the build process automatically."
  - question: "What quality setting should I use for food photography?"
    answer: "<strong>80–85% quality</strong> in JPEG or WebP is the sweet spot for food photography. This achieves 70–80% file size reduction with virtually no visible quality loss. Below 75%, you may start seeing colour banding and loss of detail that can make food look unappetising."
  - question: "Should I include location keywords in image alt text?"
    answer: "Yes—when it's natural and accurate. For example: \"Wood-fired pizza at [Restaurant Name], Northbridge Perth\" is helpful for local SEO. But don't keyword-stuff; write for humans first, search engines second. Alt text is also critical for accessibility."
  - question: "How much can image optimisation improve my PageSpeed score?"
    answer: "Significantly. We've seen Perth restaurant sites jump from 30–40/100 to 85–95/100 primarily through image optimisation. For image-heavy hospitality sites, unoptimised photos are almost always the biggest performance bottleneck. It's often the single highest-impact fix available."

<p>
  <strong>Image compression reduces file size without noticeable quality loss, directly improving page speed—a key Google ranking factor.</strong> For Perth restaurants, cafés and bars in Northbridge, Fremantle, Subiaco, and beyond, slow‑loading images can increase bounce rates by up to 40% and push your site down in local search results. Many photographers deliver stunning high‑resolution files that are perfect for print but disastrous for the web, unintentionally harming their clients' online visibility. This guide explains the SEO impact of image compression, common mistakes photographers make, and how to balance visual quality with web performance.
</p>

<p>
  According to Google's data, <strong>sites that load within 3 seconds have 32% lower bounce rates</strong> than those taking 5 seconds. With over 60% of Perth hospitality searches happening on mobile—often on patchy 4G connections in areas like Fremantle's waterfront or Northbridge's busy streets—every kilobyte counts. If your mouth‑watering dish photos are slowing down your menu, you're not just testing customers' patience—you're telling Google your site provides a poor user experience.
</p>

<h2>What Is Image Compression?</h2>

<p>
  Image compression is the process of reducing the file size of a digital image. There are two primary methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Lossy compression:</strong> Permanently removes some data (like subtle colour variations) to achieve smaller file sizes. Formats like JPEG and WebP use lossy compression. When done correctly, the quality loss is invisible to the human eye.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lossless compression:</strong> Reduces file size without discarding any data, perfect for graphics with sharp edges or text. PNG and GIF are lossless formats, but they often produce larger files than lossy equivalents for photographic content.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For web use, <strong>WebP</strong> (with JPEG fallbacks) is the modern standard because it offers superior compression ratios—typically 25–35% smaller than JPEG at the same perceived quality. That means faster downloads, lower data usage for mobile customers, and better Core Web Vitals scores.
</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation for Perth hospitality websites:</strong> Use WebP as your primary format with JPEG fallbacks for older browsers. Reserve PNG for logos and graphics only.</p>

<h2>The SEO Connection: Why Speed Matters for Perth Venues</h2>

<p>
  Google's Core Web Vitals include <strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>, which measures how long the largest image or text block takes to appear. Unoptimized hero images are the most common cause of poor LCP. If your signature dish photo takes five seconds to load, Google sees that as a bad user experience and may rank your site lower in search results. (For a deeper dive into Core Web Vitals, read our guide on <a href="/blog/core-web-vitals-hospitality-websites-explained-simply">Core Web Vitals for hospitality websites</a>.)
</p>

<p>
  Beyond rankings, speed affects conversions directly. A study by Portent found that <strong>the highest‑converting e‑commerce sites load in 1.9 seconds or less</strong>. For Perth venues, that could mean the difference between a customer booking a table or bouncing to a competitor with a faster site.
</p>

<h2>Load Time Impact on User Behaviour</h2>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Image compression is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve LCP. By reducing file sizes, you decrease the amount of data that must be downloaded, allowing the browser to paint the page faster. This is especially critical for mobile users in areas with slower 4G coverage, such as Fremantle's waterfront, Northbridge's crowded streets, or Scarborough's beach dining areas.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes Photographers Make</h2>

<p>
  Most professional photographers are trained to deliver the highest possible quality for print, not for the web. This leads to several well‑intentioned but harmful practices that we see constantly from Perth venues:
</p>

<h3>1. Delivering Huge, Uncompressed Files</h3>

<p>
  A typical high‑resolution RAW file can be 30–50 MB. Even after editing, photographers often export JPEGs at 100% quality, resulting in 5–10 MB files. A single hero image that size can single‑handedly push your LCP beyond 5 seconds, triggering Google's "Needs Improvement" flag.
</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>Export Setting</th>
      <th>Typical File Size</th>
      <th>Web Suitability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>JPEG 100% quality</td>
      <td>5–10 MB</td>
      <td>❌ Too large</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JPEG 95% quality</td>
      <td>2–5 MB</td>
      <td>❌ Still too large</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JPEG 85% quality</td>
      <td>500 KB–1.5 MB</td>
      <td>⚠️ Acceptable but not optimal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WebP 85% quality</td>
      <td>200–500 KB</td>
      <td>✅ Optimal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WebP 80% quality</td>
      <td>150–400 KB</td>
      <td>✅ Optimal</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>2. Using the Wrong File Format</h3>

<p>
  TIFF and PNG are great for print and graphics but terrible for web photos because they produce unnecessarily large files. JPEG (or better, WebP) should be the default for any photographic content on a website.
</p>

<h3>3. Ignoring Responsive Image Sizes</h3>

<p>
  A one‑size‑fits‑all image that's 4000 pixels wide is overkill for a mobile screen. Modern websites should serve different image sizes based on the viewer's device—a technique called responsive images. Photographers who deliver only a single resolution force developers to resize on the fly, often leading to suboptimal compression or layout shifts.
</p>

<h3>4. Over‑Optimizing (The "Pixel‑Pushing" Trap)</h3>

<p>
  On the other end of the spectrum, some photographers compress images so aggressively that details become blurry, colours band, and appetising food looks unappealing. This defeats the purpose of professional photography and can hurt conversion rates just as much as slow loading. The sweet spot is 80–85% quality—invisible quality loss with significant size reduction.
</p>

<h3>5. Missing Metadata and Alt Text</h3>

<p>
  Photographers often strip EXIF data for privacy but forget to add web-essential metadata. For SEO, every image needs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Descriptive filename:</strong> <code>crispy-pork-belly-northbridge-restaurant.webp</code> not <code>IMG_4523.jpg</code></li>
  <li><strong>Alt text:</strong> "Crispy pork belly with apple reduction at [Restaurant Name], Northbridge Perth"</li>
  <li><strong>Title attribute:</strong> Optional but useful for additional context</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Photographer‑Developer Gap</h2>

<p>
  Photographers focus on aesthetics, lighting, and composition. Developers focus on performance, code, and user experience. Rarely do the two disciplines speak the same language. The result? Beautiful images that slow down websites, or fast websites with mediocre visuals.
</p>

<p>
  At Amplify Creative Lab, we bridge that gap. Our team includes both professional photographers and experienced web developers, so we understand how to capture stunning food photography <em>and</em> optimise it for the web without compromising quality. This unique combination gives Perth venues across Northbridge, Fremantle, Subiaco, and the CBD a competitive edge that most competitors simply can't match. (See how professional photography boosts conversions in our article on <a href="/blog/roi-professional-food-photography-perth">the ROI of professional food photography for Perth venues</a>.)

<h2>Case Study: Before and After Compression</h2>

<p>
  We recently worked with a Perth CBD restaurant that was struggling with slow mobile load times. Their hero image—a beautiful shot of their signature pasta—was a 6.2 MB JPEG. After optimising it to WebP at 85% quality and resizing to 1920px, the file size dropped to 420 KB (a 93% reduction). The restaurant's LCP improved from 5.8 seconds to 1.9 seconds, and mobile bookings increased by 18% within a month.

<h2>Compression Isn't About Sacrificing Quality</h2>

<p>
  The goal of image compression isn't to make your photos look worse; it's to make them load faster without anyone noticing the difference. When done correctly, compression is invisible to the customer but highly visible to Google—and that's what drives more traffic, more bookings, and more revenue for your Perth venue.
</p>

<p>
  If you're working with a photographer who doesn't understand web optimisation, or if you're unsure how your current images are affecting your site's speed, it's time to take action. This is especially important for Perth venues in competitive areas like Northbridge and Fremantle where every advantage matters.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Image Compression for Restaurant Websites</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Lossy compression</strong> removes some data to achieve smaller file sizes; <strong>lossless compression</strong> reduces file size without any data loss. For web photos, lossy compression (JPEG, WebP) is preferred because the quality loss is unnoticeable at 80–85% quality settings—and file sizes are dramatically smaller.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I know if my images are too large?</h3>
  <p>
    Run your site through <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. If LCP is flagged as "Poor" (red) or "Needs Improvement" (orange), and the report mentions "image optimization" or "properly size images," your images are likely too large. Our mini‑audit provides a detailed breakdown.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I compress images after they're already on my website?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. You can use tools like Squoosh, ImageOptim, or WordPress plugins (ShortPixel, Imagify) to compress existing images. However, for best results, it's better to re‑export from the original high‑resolution files with the correct dimensions and quality settings—you'll get better quality at smaller sizes.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need to use WebP if my site is built on WordPress?</h3>
  <p>
    WebP is strongly recommended but not mandatory. Many WordPress plugins (e.g., ShortPixel, Imagify) can automatically convert uploaded images to WebP and serve them to supported browsers with JPEG fallbacks. If you're on a custom Astro or Next.js site, we bake WebP conversion into the build process automatically.
  </p>

  <h3>What quality setting should I use for food photography?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>80–85% quality</strong> in JPEG or WebP is the sweet spot for food photography. This achieves 70–80% file size reduction with virtually no visible quality loss. Below 75%, you may start seeing colour banding and loss of detail that can make food look unappetising.
  </p>

  <h3>Should I include location keywords in image alt text?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes—when it's natural and accurate. For example: "Wood-fired pizza at [Restaurant Name], Northbridge Perth" is helpful for local SEO. But don't keyword-stuff; write for humans first, search engines second. Alt text is also critical for accessibility.
  </p>

  <h3>How much can image optimisation improve my PageSpeed score?</h3>
  <p>
    Significantly. We've seen Perth restaurant sites jump from 30–40/100 to 85–95/100 primarily through image optimisation. For image-heavy hospitality sites, unoptimised photos are almost always the biggest performance bottleneck. It's often the single highest-impact fix available.
