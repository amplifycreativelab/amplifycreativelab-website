faq:
  - question: "Do I need a CDN if my website is already hosted in Australia?"
    answer: "Yes. Even with Australian hosting, a CDN can improve performance by caching content at multiple edge locations within the country (e.g., Perth, Sydney, Melbourne). This reduces latency for visitors in different suburbs and provides redundancy against server outages."
  - question: "How long does it take to implement CDN, caching and optimization?"
    answer: "For an existing site, basic implementation can often be completed within a few hours. A comprehensive optimisation that includes image conversion, code minification and caching configuration typically takes 1–2 days. For new sites, we build these techniques into the development process from the start."
  - question: "Will caching break my website updates?"
    answer: "Properly configured caching includes mechanisms to invalidate the cache when content changes. We use cache‑busting techniques (like versioned file names) to ensure visitors always see the latest version of your menu, prices and promotions."
  - question: "Can I add a CDN to my WordPress site?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Many CDN providers offer WordPress‑specific plugins (e.g., Cloudflare, WP Rocket) that make integration straightforward. However, for optimal performance, we recommend a custom‑built Astro site where CDN, caching and optimization are deeply integrated into the architecture.

{/* Key Takeaways for AI Engines and Quick Readers */}
<aside className="key-takeaways">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CDN + Caching + Optimization = 50-70% faster load times</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Sites loading in 3s have 32% lower bounce rates</strong> than sites taking 5s (Google data)</li>
    <li><strong>Case study:</strong> Fremantle café went from 4.0s to 1.3s (68% improvement), +22% bookings</li>
    <li><strong>CDN:</strong> Serves content from Perth servers instead of distant data centres</li>
    <li><strong>All three work together:</strong> Optimization shrinks files, caching stores them, CDN delivers them fast</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

<p>
  <strong>A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a globally distributed server network that delivers web content faster by serving it from a location closer to your visitors.</strong> Combined with caching (storing copies of files to reduce server load) and optimization (minifying code, compressing images, and streamlining assets), these three techniques form the backbone of a high‑performance website. For Perth cafés, restaurants and bars, implementing all three can cut load times by 50–70%, directly improving Google rankings and customer conversion rates.
</p>

<p>
  According to Google's data, <strong>sites that load within 3 seconds have 32% lower bounce rates</strong> than those taking 5 seconds. With over 60% of Perth hospitality searches happening on mobile, every second counts. If your menu, photos and booking system are delayed by slow servers, unoptimized images or missing caching, you're not just testing customers' patience—you're telling Google your site provides a poor user experience.
</p>

<h2>What Is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?</h2>

<p>
  A CDN is a network of servers spread across multiple geographic locations. When a customer in Fremantle visits your café website, the CDN serves your images, CSS, JavaScript and HTML from a server in Perth (or even closer) instead of from a single origin server that might be overseas. This reduces the physical distance data must travel, resulting in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Faster load times</strong> – especially for media‑heavy sites with food photography</li>
  <li><strong>Better reliability</strong> – if one server fails, traffic is routed to another</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced bandwidth costs</strong> – offloading traffic from your main server</li>
  <li><strong>Improved security</strong> – many CDNs offer DDoS protection and SSL/TLS encryption</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For Perth venues, a CDN means your mouth‑watering dish photos load almost instantly, whether the customer is browsing from Northbridge on 4G or from Scarborough on a home Wi‑Fi connection.
</p>

<h2>What Is Caching?</h2>

<p>
  Caching stores copies of files (like HTML pages, images, and stylesheets) so they can be delivered faster on subsequent visits. There are several types of caching that matter for café websites:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Browser caching:</strong> Files are stored on the visitor's own device, so returning customers don't have to download them again.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Server‑side caching:</strong> Your web server generates a static version of dynamic pages (like your menu or blog) and serves that instead of rebuilding the page from scratch every time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CDN caching:</strong> The CDN stores static assets at its edge locations, reducing the load on your origin server and speeding up delivery.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Effective caching can turn a 3‑second page load into a 1‑second load for repeat visitors—a critical advantage in the competitive Perth hospitality market where customers often compare multiple venues before deciding where to book.
</p>

<h2>What Is Optimization?</h2>

<p>
  Optimization refers to the techniques that reduce the size and complexity of your website's files. For café websites, the most impactful optimizations are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Image compression:</strong> Converting high‑resolution photos to modern formats like WebP and resizing them to appropriate dimensions (see our guide on <a href="/blog/how-image-compression-impacts-seo-why-photographers-get-it-wrong">image compression and SEO</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Code minification:</strong> Removing unnecessary characters from CSS, JavaScript and HTML without changing functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Lazy loading:</strong> Deferring the loading of images and other assets until they're about to appear on screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Critical CSS inlining:</strong> Loading the styles needed for the initial viewport first, then loading the rest asynchronously.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Optimization ensures that every byte sent to the visitor's browser is as efficient as possible. When you combine optimization with CDN and caching, you create a website that feels instantaneous—even on slower mobile networks around Perth's suburbs.
</p>

<h2>How CDN, Caching & Optimization Work Together</h2>

<p>
  These three technologies aren't standalone fixes; they're layers of a performance stack that multiply each other's benefits. Here's how they interact for a typical Perth café website:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Optimization</strong> reduces the size of your hero image from 5 MB to 500 KB (WebP compression, proper dimensions).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Caching</strong> stores that optimized image in the visitor's browser and on the CDN edge servers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CDN</strong> delivers the cached, optimized image from a server in Perth instead of from a distant data centre.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The result is a hero image that loads in under 1 second instead of 5+ seconds. This synergy is why implementing just one or two of these techniques often yields disappointing results—you need all three to achieve the dramatic speed improvements that Google rewards and customers expect.
</p>

<h2>The Impact on Core Web Vitals & SEO</h2>

<p>
  Google's Core Web Vitals measure real‑world user experience, and each of the three pillars directly affects these metrics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> CDN and caching reduce server response times; optimization ensures the largest image is small enough to paint quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Properly optimized images have explicit dimensions, preventing unexpected layout shifts as they load.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP):</strong> Cached and minified JavaScript files respond faster to user interactions like menu clicks or booking‑button taps.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For Perth venues, improving Core Web Vitals isn't just about pleasing Google—it's about creating a smooth, frustration‑free experience that turns browsers into bookings. (Learn more about these metrics in our article on <a href="/blog/core-web-vitals-hospitality-websites-explained-simply">Core Web Vitals for hospitality websites</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Case Study: A Fremantle Café's 68% Speed Improvement</h2>

<p>
  We recently worked with a Fremantle café whose website was struggling with 4‑second load times on mobile. The site had no CDN, minimal caching, and unoptimized images. After implementing a three‑layer approach:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enabled a global CDN with an edge location in Perth</li>
  <li>Configured server‑side and browser caching for all static assets</li>
  <li>Compressed and converted all menu and gallery images to WebP</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The mobile load time dropped to 1.3 seconds—a 68% improvement. Within a month, the café's Google ranking for "best coffee Fremantle" moved from page 2 to page 1, and online bookings increased by 22%. The investment in performance paid for itself in under six weeks.
