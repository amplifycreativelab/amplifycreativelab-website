faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between Google Street View and a Custom 360 Tour?"
    answer: "Google Street View is great for visibility on Maps but has limited quality and navigation. A custom commercial tour (like Matterport or 3DVista) offers high-definition imagery, info hotspots, floor plans, and a branded interface embedded directly on your website."
  - question: "How much does a 360 virtual tour cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Pricing depends on the size of the space. A small cafe might cost $400-$600, while a large wedding venue or multi-level function centre typically ranges from $800 to $1,500+ including hosting setup."
  - question: "Do virtual tours replace in-person viewings?"
    answer: "No, they *qualify* them. A virtual tour helps potential clients rule you *in*. By the time they book a physical inspection, they are already familiar with the layout and serious about buying/booking. It saves your sales team time on low-quality leads."
  - question: "Can I view 360 tours on mobile?"
    answer: "Yes, modern 360 tours are fully responsive. Users can navigate by swiping on their phone or tablet, making it perfect for showing venues to partners or decision-makers who aren't present."

For Perth wedding venues, function centres, and real estate developers, selling a physical space is the core business. But relying solely on static photos requires customers to use their imagination to stitch the room together.

360° virtual tours bridge that gap. They provide an immersive, interactive experience that lets users walk through your doors from anywhere in the world.

## Why Perth Venues Are Adopting 360 Tech

### 1. The Destination Wedding Market
Perth and the South West (Margaret River) are huge wedding destinations. Couples from the UK, Singapore, or just Sydney often can't fly over for an initial viewing. A high-def virtual tour lets them check sightlines, floor space, and flow, giving them the confidence to put down a deposit sight-unseen.

### 2. Corporate Function Planners are Busy
Event managers don't have time to physically visit five different venues in the CBD just to check if the ceiling is high enough for a projector. A virtual tour answers their logistical questions instantly.

### 3. Trust and Transparency
Static photos can be deceptive (wide-angle lenses making rooms look huge). A walk-through tour builds trust because "what you see is what you Get". There are no hidden corners.

## Matterport vs. Custom Tours

### Matterport
*   **The Standard:** Famous for the "Dollhouse View" (3D floor plan).
*   **Pros:** Smooth navigation, accurate measurements (great for architects/planners).
*   **Cons:** Monthly hosting fees, sometimes lower image resolution.

### Custom 360 Photography (3DVista / Kuula)
*   **The Quality Choice:** High-resolution DSLR photography stitched into a tour.
*   **Pros:** Better dynamic range (views out windows look clear, not blown out), fully branded interface, no recurring fees (usually).
*   **Cons:** No "Dollhouse" 3D mesh effect.

At Amplify, we offer both solutions depending on your needs. For real estate, we lean towards Matterport. For luxury hospitality, we prefer high-res Custom Tours.

## How to Prepare Your Venue for a 360 Shoot

Unlike a static photo shoot where we can move a messy pile of chairs out of frame, the 360 camera sees *everything*.

1.  **Hide the Cords:** Tidy up POS terminals, hiding cables behind counters.
2.  **Set the Tables:** Fully set tables for a wedding/dinner service (glassware, cutlery, napkins).
3.  **Lighting:** Turn on all accent lights. Check for blown bulbs.
4.  **Open Doors:** Keep internal doors open to show flow; close bathrooms/store rooms.

## Case Study: "The Virtual Inspection"

We implemented a 360 tour for a riverside venue in South Perth.
*   **Before:** Sales team spent 15 hours/week on initial viewings, with a 20% conversion rate.
*   **After:** Website visitors viewed the tour. Physical viewings dropped to 8 hours/week, but conversion rose to **65%**.
*   **Result:** Less time wasted, more qualified leads.
