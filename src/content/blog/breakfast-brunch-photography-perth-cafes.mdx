faq:
  - question: "What's the best time of day to photograph breakfast dishes in Perth?"
    answer: "Golden hour morning light (6:30-8:30am in summer, 7:30-9:30am in winter) creates the warm, inviting glow that makes breakfast dishes look irresistible. North-facing windows in Perth cafés capture this light beautifully."
  - question: "How do I make avocado toast look Instagram-worthy in photos?"
    answer: "Use ripe (but not overripe) avocado for vibrant colour, add texture with seeds and microgreens, capture from overhead with natural side lighting, and include a latte or juice for context. The toast should be just-golden, not too dark."
  - question: "Should I use a professional photographer for my Perth café's menu?"
    answer: "Yes, for hero dishes that appear on your website, Google Business Profile, and marketing materials. Quality photography drives 30% higher click-through rates. Use pro shots for key items, phone shots for daily specials."
  - question: "What camera settings work best for café photography?"
    answer: "Use a wide aperture (f/2.8-4) for creamy background blur, ISO 400-800 in natural light, and shutter speed around 1/125. Shoot in RAW for editing flexibility. For phones, use portrait mode in good lighting."
  - question: "How do I photograph hot coffee without steam disappearing?"
    answer: "Work quickly—steam only lasts 30-60 seconds. Have everything styled before the coffee arrives. Use a dark or contrasting background to make steam visible. Microwave a damp cloth nearby to add humidity."
  - question: "What props work best for Perth café photography?"
    answer: "Use natural materials: wooden boards, marble surfaces, linen napkins, and ceramic plates in earthy tones. Native Australian elements (eucalyptus, banksia flowers) add unique Perth character. Avoid cluttered or dated props."
  - question: "How often should I update my café's food photography?"
    answer: "Refresh hero images with each seasonal menu change (quarterly). Update social media content weekly. Reshoot completely at least annually or whenever you renovate, rebrand, or significantly change your menu."
  - question: "What's the biggest mistake Perth cafés make with food photography?"
    answer: "Using harsh overhead lighting or flash that creates unflattering shadows and washes out colours. Natural side lighting is always more appetising than direct artificial light, no matter how good your dish looks in person."

Breakfast and brunch are the heart of Perth's café culture. From Leederville's bustling morning scene to Fremantle's beachside cafés, the first meal of the day drives loyal customers and lucrative weekend trade. But with Instagram setting expectations higher than ever, your dishes need to look as good as they taste.

This guide covers everything you need to photograph breakfast and brunch dishes that convert scrollers into customers—whether you're a café owner with a smartphone or preparing for a [professional food photography](/perth-food-photography/) session.

## Why Breakfast Photography Matters for Perth Cafés

Breakfast and brunch drive significant revenue for Perth hospitality:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Brunch accounts for **30-40% of café revenue** | Weekend brunch is a major profit driver |
| **67% of diners** check social media before trying a new café | Your photos influence first visits |
| Dishes with photos on menus see **30% higher orders** | Visual menus convert browsers |
| **85% of Perth café searches** happen on mobile | Your images must look great on small screens |

In competitive suburbs like Mount Lawley, Leederville, and Fremantle, outstanding food photography is what separates packed cafés from empty ones.

## Understanding Morning Light

The secret weapon of breakfast photography is light—and Perth's abundant sunshine is a blessing when used correctly.

### Golden Hour Magic

Perth's morning golden hour creates warm, soft light that wraps around food beautifully:

- **Summer:** 5:30-7:30am (golden), 7:30-10am (soft)
- **Winter:** 6:30-8:30am (golden), 8:30-11am (soft)

This light makes food look warm, fresh, and appetising—exactly what breakfast should be.

### Best Window Positioning

For Perth cafés, north-facing windows provide the most consistent morning light:

| Window Direction | Morning Light Quality | Best For |
|------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **North-facing** | Soft, even, long-lasting | Hero shots, extended sessions |
| **East-facing** | Bright, warm, but brief | Quick golden hour shots |
| **West-facing** | Avoided for morning shoots | Afternoon sessions only |
| **South-facing** | Cool, diffused | Consistent but less warm |

**Pro tip:** Scout your café's lighting at different times. Find the "magic spot" where natural light creates soft shadows without harsh contrasts.

### Managing Harsh Light

Perth's intense summer sun can create unflattering shadows:

- **Diffuse direct sun** with sheer curtains, photography scrims, or even parchment paper
- **Avoid midday shoots** when light is overhead and harsh
- **Use reflectors** (white foam board works perfectly) to bounce light into shadows

## Essential Breakfast Subjects

### 1. The Hero Avocado Toast

No Perth café Instagram is complete without the perfect avo toast shot:

**Styling Tips:**
- Use ripe avocado—bright green, not brown
- Add texture: everything bagel seasoning, feta crumbles, chilli flakes
- Include one runny egg (pierce just before shooting)
- Layer microgreens or edible flowers for colour
- Toast should be golden, not dark

**Camera Angle:** Overhead (flat lay) for the classic Instagram shot

### 2. Stack Shots (Pancakes, Waffles, French Toast)

Stacked breakfast dishes are visual drama:

**Styling Tips:**
- Build height—three pancakes minimum
- Add pats of butter that look like they're just-melting
- Drizzle syrup in real-time and capture the pour
- Include fresh berries in odd numbers (3 or 5)
- Dust with icing sugar using a fine sieve

**Camera Angle:** 45° angle to show height and layers, or straight-on profile

### 3. The Complete Breakfast Plate

Classic eggs, bacon, and toast arrangements:

**Styling Tips:**
- Arrange components with negative space between them
- Position eggs so yolks face the camera
- Bacon should be slightly curved, not flat
- Toast cut diagonally for visual interest
- Add a pop of colour: grilled tomato, avocado, herbs

**Camera Angle:** 30-45° to show depth and all components

### 4. Coffee + Dish Pairings

Breakfast dishes always look better with a beverage:

**Styling Tips:**
- Position coffee cup at a supporting angle (not competing with food)
- Ensure latte art is fresh and visible
- Create a "scene" rather than isolated products
- Include hands reaching for cups to add life

**Camera Angle:** Overhead for flat lays; 45° for latte art detail

### 5. Smoothie Bowls and Açaí

These are Instagram gold when done right:

**Styling Tips:**
- Create organised patterns with toppings
- Use contrasting colours (pink bowl + green kiwi)
- Add height with granola clusters
- Include the spoon half-submerged
- Drizzle honey or nut butter in the final moments

**Camera Angle:** Strictly overhead

## Composition Techniques for Breakfast

### The Rule of Thirds

Place your hero dish at an intersection point, not dead-center:

```
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │     │     │
│     │ ★   │     │  ← Hero dish at intersection
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│     │     │     │
│     │     │     │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│     │     │     │
│     │     │     │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

### Negative Space

Leave breathing room. Cramped photos look chaotic; space creates elegance.

### Leading Lines

Use cutlery, table edges, or napkins to guide the eye toward your hero dish.

### Odd Numbers

Group elements in threes or fives. Three pancakes, five strawberries, three coffee cups in a flat lay.

## Styling Breakfast Dishes

### Before the Shoot

**Prep work:**
1. Choose your freshest, most photogenic ingredients
2. Have backups ready—you might need multiple plates
3. Brief kitchen staff on timing (dishes cool quickly)
4. Set up your background and props first
5. Test lighting and camera settings with a stand-in dish

**Prop selection for Perth cafés:**
- Wooden boards and slabs (Jarrah adds local character)
- Marble pastry slabs for contrast
- Linen napkins in neutral tones
- Vintage cutlery for character
- Fresh native flowers (wax flower, eucalyptus)
- Quality ceramics—avoid chipped or dated plates

### During the Shoot

**Working quickly:**
- Breakfast dishes have a 5-15 minute window before they look tired
- Hot items (pancakes, eggs) degrade fastest
- Salads and cold items are more forgiving
- Shoot in batches: style → photograph → reset

**Enhancing dishes:**
- Brush oil on avocado to prevent browning
- Apply glycerine-water mix to fruit for freshness
- Use tweezers for micro-positioning
- Spray water on glasses for condensation
- Add herbs at the last moment—they wilt quickly

## Movement and Action Shots

Static breakfast photos are fine. Action photos are magnetic.

### Shots That Tell Stories

| Action | How to Capture | Why It Works |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Pouring syrup | Continuous burst mode | Creates anticipation |
| Breaking egg yolk | Video or burst mode | Satisfying and relatable |
| Steam rising | Dark background, backlight | Suggests warmth and freshness |
| Hand holding coffee | Include partial arm/hand | Adds human element |
| Cutting into dish | Mid-slice moment | Shows texture inside |

### Technical Tips for Action

- Use a fast shutter speed (1/250 or faster)
- Continuous shooting mode for the perfect moment
- Manual focus pre-set on the dish
- Have someone pour/cut while you shoot
- Allow for 10-20 attempts per action

## Phone Photography Tips

Not every café can afford regular professional shoots. Here's how to get quality results with your smartphone:

### Camera Settings

- **Portrait Mode:** Creates background blur (bokeh)
- **HDR:** Off—it can make food look unnatural
- **Flash:** Always off—natural light only
- **Grid:** On—for composition guidance

### Free Editing Apps

| App | Best For | Platform |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Snapseed | Exposure, colour, detail | iOS, Android |
| VSCO | Consistent filters, colour grading | iOS, Android |
| Lightroom Mobile | Professional adjustments | iOS, Android |
| Foodie | Food-specific filters | iOS, Android |

### Quick Edit Workflow

1. Straighten and crop
2. Lift shadows slightly
3. Increase contrast moderately
4. Boost saturation (but don't overdo it)
5. Add slight warmth for breakfast vibes
6. Sharpen for final clarity

## When to Hire a Professional

Phone shots work for daily specials and social media. But certain applications demand professional quality:

### Professional Photography Worth the Investment

- **Website hero images:** Your homepage first impression
- **Google Business Profile:** Main photos seen in local search
- **Menu cover shots:** Key dishes that define your brand
- **Advertising campaigns:** Paid promotion needs polish
- **Print materials:** Flyers, window signage, menus

### What to Expect from a Pro Shoot

A [professional food photography](/perth-food-photography/) session for a Perth café typically includes:

| Element | Standard Session |
|---------|------------------|
| Preparation time | 1-2 hours (styling, lighting) |
| Active shooting | 2-4 hours |
| Dishes covered | 8-15 hero images |
| Edits included | Full professional retouching |
| Delivery | High-res + web-optimised |

**Pro tip:** Schedule shoots for early morning when dishes are freshest and light is best. Coordinate with kitchen for perfectly-timed dishes.

## Seasonal Considerations for Perth

Perth's seasons influence both what you serve and how it photographs:

### Summer (December-February)

- Bright, harsh light—shoot earlier (before 8am)
- Feature açaí bowls, smoothies, cold-pressed juices
- Add ice and condensation for refreshment cues
- Outdoor settings can work at sunrise

### Autumn (March-May)

- Ideal photography weather—soft but warm light
- Transition to heartier offerings (eggs, porridge)
- Use warm colour palettes in styling
- Coffees and chai become more prominent

### Winter (June-August)

- Embrace moody, dramatic lighting
- Feature comfort food: big breakfasts, baked eggs
- Steam and warmth become key visual elements
- Shoot closer to 10-11am for usable light

### Spring (September-November)

- Fresh, bright aesthetic suits the season
- Emphasise seasonal fruits and flowers
- Lighter dishes return: granola, fresh juices
- Excellent light for outdoor furniture shots

## Building Your Photo Library

For Perth cafés, aim to build:

### Core Library (Essential)

- 3-5 hero dishes (signature items)
- 1-2 strong coffee/beverage shots
- Interior/ambiance images
- Staff-in-action shots
- Exterior/signage

### Seasonal Updates (Quarterly)

- 2-3 new seasonal dishes
- Featured specials
- Holiday/event imagery (Easter brunch, etc.)

### Social Content (Ongoing)

- Weekly behind-the-scenes
- Customer-service moments
- Daily specials (phone quality fine)
- Stories and reels b-roll

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Using Flash

Direct flash creates harsh shadows and washes out colour. Natural light always looks more appetising.

### 2. Overhead Café Lighting

Those warm Edison bulbs look great in person but photograph yellow-orange. Switch to natural light for shoots.

### 3. Over-Editing

Boosting saturation until avocado looks neon green destroys credibility. Keep edits subtle.

### 4. Dead Space

Empty plates mid-meal aren't aspirational. Photograph dishes full, fresh, and ready to eat.

### 5. Inconsistent Style

Jumping between moody-dark and bright-airy confuses your brand. Pick an aesthetic and stick to it.

### 6. Ignoring the Background

Beautiful food on a cluttered table with visible clutter ruins the shot. Clean backgrounds only.
