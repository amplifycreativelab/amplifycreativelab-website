<p>
  DIY website builders like Wix and Squarespace promise easy, affordable websites for Perth restaurants and cafés—but they often deliver slow loading times, poor SEO, and a generic look that fails to convert hungry customers. <strong>What is the real cost of a DIY platform?</strong> It's not just the monthly subscription; it's lost bookings, higher bounce rates, and a weakened local search presence. Research shows that <strong>40% of users abandon a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load</strong>, and many DIY‑built hospitality sites exceed that threshold. In Perth's competitive dining scene—from Northbridge to Fremantle, Mount Lawley to the CBD—that's a recipe for empty tables.

<h2>The Bloat Problem – Why DIY Platforms Are Slow</h2>
<p>
  Wix, Squarespace and similar drag‑and‑drop builders are designed to be one‑size‑fits‑all. To support every possible feature, they load hundreds of kilobytes of generic JavaScript, CSS and tracking scripts—even for a simple restaurant menu page. This "code bloat" directly hurts <strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>, Google's key performance metrics:
</p>

<h3>How DIY Platforms Hurt Core Web Vitals</h3>

      <td>Under 2.5s</td>
      <td>Users leave before seeing your content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</strong></td>
      <td>0.2–0.5</td>
      <td>Under 0.1</td>
      <td>Frustrating jumps when trying to tap buttons</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</strong></td>
      <td>300–500ms</td>
      <td>Under 200ms</td>
      <td>Laggy response on booking forms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Total page weight</strong></td>
      <td>3–8 MB</td>
      <td>Under 1.5 MB</td>
      <td>Slow on mobile data</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> The time it takes for the main content to appear. DIY themes often push LCP beyond 4–5 seconds on mobile.</li>
  <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Elements jumping around as extra scripts load, frustrating users trying to tap your "Book a Table" button.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP):</strong> Delayed response when customers interact with your menu or booking form.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A 2024 study of 200 Perth hospitality websites found that <strong>DIY‑builder sites were 2.3× slower</strong> than custom‑coded alternatives. In an industry where speed directly correlates with bookings, that's a handicap you can't afford.
</p>

<h2>The SEO Limitations That Hurt Local Visibility</h2>
<p>
  Ranking for "Perth restaurant" or "Northbridge café" requires precise local SEO—something DIY platforms struggle with. You have limited control over:

      <td><strong>Canonical tags</strong></td>
      <td>Auto-generated, sometimes incorrect</td>
      <td>Precise control for duplicate content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Meta tags and descriptions:</strong> Often auto‑generated, missing local keywords.</li>
  <li><strong>URL structure:</strong> Bloated, parameter‑heavy URLs that Google dislikes.</li>
  <li><strong>Structured data (Schema):</strong> Critical for showing your menu, hours and location in search results. Most DIY themes offer minimal or incorrect Schema.</li>
  <li><strong>Image optimization:</strong> Uploaded photos are often served at full resolution, slowing your site further.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Google's algorithm increasingly rewards fast, mobile‑friendly, locally‑optimised sites. A generic Wix template simply can't compete with a <strong>custom‑coded Perth hospitality website</strong> built with local SEO as a core feature.

</p>

<h2>The "Cookie‑Cutter" Look – Why Branding Suffers</h2>
<p>
  Your venue is unique—your website should be too. DIY templates are used by thousands of businesses worldwide, creating a sameness that makes it hard to stand out in Perth's crowded hospitality market. More importantly, these templates are rarely designed with <strong>hospitality‑specific needs</strong> in mind:

  <li>Gallery layouts that showcase professional food photography without slowing the page.</li>
  <li>Clear calls‑to‑action for takeaways, events or private dining.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When your site looks like every other café or bar, you lose the opportunity to tell your story and build a memorable brand.

  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Premium templates:</strong> Many attractive designs require an upgrade.</li>
  <li><strong>Third‑party plugins:</strong> Booking systems, advanced galleries, SEO tools—each adds another monthly fee.</li>
  <li><strong>Removing platform branding:</strong> Often requires a higher‑tier subscription.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer time:</strong> When you hit a limitation, you may need to hire a "Wix Expert" or "Squarespace Specialist" at hourly rates that erase any initial savings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Over three years, a DIY site can easily cost <strong>$2,000–$4,000</strong> in subscriptions and plugins—money that could have been invested in a custom site that performs better, ranks higher and never charges recurring platform fees.

</p>

<h2>The Custom‑Code Alternative – Built for Hospitality</h2>
<p>
  A custom‑coded website, built with modern frameworks like <strong>Astro</strong> or <strong>Next.js</strong>, strips away all the bloat. It includes only the code your venue actually needs, resulting in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lightning‑fast load times:</strong> Pages that score 95+ on Google Lighthouse.</li>
  <li><strong>Full SEO control:</strong> Every meta tag, URL and structured data element is hand‑crafted for Perth‑specific keywords.</li>
  <li><strong>Unique, mobile‑first design:</strong> A site that reflects your brand and guides customers effortlessly to a booking.</li>
  <li><strong>No ongoing platform fees:</strong> You own the code outright; hosting is a fraction of the cost of a DIY subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Because we specialise in both <strong>web development and professional photography</strong>, we can create a site where every image is optimised for speed and appetite appeal—a combination most DIY platforms can't match. For a platform comparison, see our article on <a href="/blog/astro-vs-wordpress-hospitality-websites-perth">Astro vs WordPress for hospitality websites</a>.

<h3>Case Study – A Perth Café's Switch from Squarespace to Custom</h3>
<p>
  A popular café in Leederville was using a Squarespace template. Despite great food and location, their online bookings were stagnant and Google rankings were poor. We rebuilt their site with a custom Astro front‑end, integrated their reservation system, and optimised every image for WebP.

  The café now pays less in annual hosting than they did for their Squarespace plan, and they have a site that can grow with their business.

<h2>Your Website Is Your Digital Front Door – Don't Settle for a Template</h2>
<p>
  DIY platforms serve a purpose for simple blogs or portfolios, but Perth hospitality venues need more. Your website is your <strong>digital front door</strong>—it should be fast, welcoming, and designed to turn browsers into booked tables. A custom‑coded site isn't an extravagance; it's a strategic investment that pays for itself through higher bookings, better search visibility and a stronger brand.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: DIY vs Custom Websites</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>Is Wix good for restaurant websites?</h3>
  <p>
    Wix can create a basic online presence, but it struggles with the <strong>performance, local SEO and mobile‑first design</strong> that modern restaurant websites need. For venues serious about converting visitors into bookings, a custom‑coded site is a far better investment.
  </p>

  <h3>How much does a custom website cost compared to Wix?</h3>
  <p>
    A custom Perth restaurant website typically ranges from <strong>$3,000–$12,000+</strong> (one‑time), while Wix/Squarespace plans run $300–$800+ per year. Over three years, the DIY option can cost $2,000–$4,000 with fewer benefits. The custom site delivers superior performance, SEO and conversion rates, making it the more cost‑effective long‑term choice.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I keep my Wix site and still rank well in Google?</h3>
  <p>
    It's possible to rank with a Wix site, but you'll be <strong>fighting an uphill battle</strong> against slower speed, limited SEO control and generic code. A custom site gives you every technical advantage Google rewards, making it much easier to achieve top rankings for competitive local keywords like "Perth restaurant" or "Fremantle café."
  </p>

  <h3>How long does it take to build a custom restaurant website?</h3>
  <p>
    A typical custom hospitality website takes <strong>4–8 weeks</strong> from initial consultation to launch. This includes design, development, content integration, photography optimization, and testing. The timeline is longer than spinning up a Wix template, but the result is dramatically better.
  </p>

  <h3>Will I be able to update my custom website myself?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Yes.</strong> Modern custom sites can include content management systems (like Sanity or Contentful) that let you update menus, photos, and text easily. For simpler updates, we provide training and documentation. You're never locked into depending on us for basic changes.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I already have a Wix/Squarespace site—can you migrate it?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Absolutely.</strong> We regularly migrate hospitality businesses from DIY platforms to custom-coded sites. We preserve your content, improve your SEO (often seeing a ranking boost from the speed improvement alone), and ensure a smooth transition with minimal downtime.
  </p>

  <h3>Is Squarespace better than Wix for restaurants?</h3>
  <p>
    Squarespace has slightly better design templates and marginally better performance, but it shares the same fundamental limitations: <strong>code bloat, limited SEO control, platform lock-in, and ongoing fees</strong>. For serious hospitality businesses, neither platform competes with a purpose-built custom site.
