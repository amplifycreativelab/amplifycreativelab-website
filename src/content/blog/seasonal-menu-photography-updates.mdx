faq:
  - question: "How often should we update our food photos?"
    answer: "Ideally, every time you change a significant portion of your menu, which for most seasonal restaurants is 4 times a year. At a minimum, you should have a Summer/Spring shoot (fresh, bright, salads/seafood) and a Winter/Autumn shoot (warm, moody, roasts/pastas)."
  - question: "Is a quarterly shoot expensive?"
    answer: "It's more cost-effective than you think. Because we aren't shooting the whole menu from scratch (just the 5-8 new items), these are shorter 'top-up' sessions. Many photographers offer retainer packages that make this cheaper than booking ad-hoc."
  - question: "Can't we just use stock photos for social media?"
    answer: "No. Savvy diners can spot clear stock photos instantly. It erodes trust. They want to see *your* food, plated *your* way. Using generic photos sets expectations you might not meet, or undersells the quality you actually deliver."
  - question: "What if our menu doesn't change much?"
    answer: "Even if the core dishes stay the same, the ingredients or sides might change. Or, you can style the same dish differently to match the season—ice-cold beer pairings in summer, red wine in winter. Context is everything."
  - question: "Does fresh photography help with SEO?"
    answer: "Yes. Google Business Profile loves fresh content. Regularly uploading new photos signals to Google that your business is active and relevant, which can help boost your local ranking in maps."

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Match the weather:</strong> Promoting a heavy beef stew during a 40-degree Perth heatwave is bad marketing. Visuals must be seasonally appropriate.</li>
    <li><strong>The 'Re-Booking' Trigger:</strong> New photos give you a legitimate reason to email your database and say "Come try this."</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Banking:</strong> Consistent quarterly shoots mean that after 12 months, you have a massive library of high-quality content to reuse next year.</li>
    <li><strong>Retainer Value:</strong> Signing a 12-month retainer with a photographer often unlocks better rates and priority booking.</li>
  </ul>

In the restaurant world, "Seasonality" is a buzzword for the kitchen. Chefs obsess over getting the first asparagus of Spring or the best truffle in Winter.

But often, the marketing lags behind. We see websites in July (Winter) still promoting Summer spritzers and salads on their homepage. This visual disconnect creates friction.

Your digital presence should mirror your kitchen: **Fresh, relevant, and in sync with the season.**

## The "Marketing Disconnect"

Imagine a customer browsing UberEats or your Instagram on a rainy Tuesday in July. They are cold and hungry.
*   **Restaurant A** shows a bright, backlit photo of a cold poke bowl.
*   **Restaurant B** highlights a steaming claypot of ragu with moody, warm lighting.

Restaurant B wins that click 9 times out of 10. Visuals trigger physical cravings. If your imagery fights against the customer's current reality (the weather), you lose the sale.

## The Strategy: Quarterly Top-Ups

You don't need a full-day production every three months. The strategy is agile:

### 1. The Core Menu (Annual)
Once a year, shoot your staples—the burger, the signature pasta, the steak frites—that never leave the menu. These are your evergreen assets.

### 2. The Seasonal Top-Up (Quarterly)
Every 3 months, book a 2-hour "mini-shoot".
*   **Shoot:** The 4-5 new specials.
*   **Shoot:** New cocktails/drinks.
*   **Shoot:** Ingredients (raw produce shots are great for storytelling).
*   **Styling:** Adjust the props. Linen napkins and heavy stoneware for winter; bright surfaces and glassware for summer.

## Benefits Beyond the Menu

### 1. Social Media Fuel
A single seasonal shoot can provide 3 months of Instagram content.
*   week 1: The "New Menu Launch" carousel.
*   week 2: Hero shot of the standout dish.
*   week 3: Chef plating video (Reel).
*   week 4: Ingredient focus.

### 2. Google Business Profile & SEO
Google aggressively favors businesses that upload photos regularly. It sees a Profile with photos added last week as "active," and one with photos from 2023 as "dormant." Regular uploads directly impact your visibility in "Restaurants near me" searches.

### 3. Email Marketing
"Our New Spring Menu is Here" is the highest-converting subject line a restaurant can send. But it only works if the email body contains drool-worthy photos of that new menu. Text isn't enough.

## Case Study: The "Summer Spritz" Effect

A Perth coastal venue we worked with had great traffic but low beverage spend.
*   **Action:** In November, we did a dedicated "Summer Spritz" shoot—bright, condensation-heavy, sun-drenched cocktail photos.
*   **Deployment:** Used on table talkers (QR codes) and paid Instagram ads targeting a 5km radius.
*   **Result:** Cocktail sales increased 40% YoY for December. The visual cue of a "refreshing drink" matched the customer's need (heat relief).
