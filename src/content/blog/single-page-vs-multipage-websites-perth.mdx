faq:
  - question: "Is a single page website cheaper than a multi-page website?"
    answer: "Generally, yes. Single page websites typically cost 30-50% less to develop due to simpler structure, fewer pages to design, and reduced content requirements. However, the cost difference narrows when comparing feature-rich single pages to basic multi-page sites."
  - question: "Are single page websites bad for SEO?"
    answer: "Single page websites face SEO challenges because you can only optimise for one primary keyword set. However, for local businesses targeting 'cafe Perth' or 'restaurant Fremantle', this limitation may not significantly impact results compared to multi-page sites."
  - question: "Which is better for a Perth restaurant: single or multi-page?"
    answer: "For most Perth restaurants, a 3-5 page website offers the best balance. You need separate pages for menus, reservations, location, and about information. Single page works if you're a small venue with a simple offering, but limits growth potential."
  - question: "Can I convert a single page website to multi-page later?"
    answer: "Yes, but it requires significant restructuring. It's often more cost-effective to add pages than rebuild entirely. If growth is likely, starting with a multi-page structure usually proves more economical long-term."
  - question: "How many pages should a small business website have?"
    answer: "Most Perth small businesses benefit from 5-10 pages: Home, About, Services (1-3 pages), Contact, and potentially Blog, Gallery, or FAQ pages. This provides enough content for SEO while remaining manageable for updates."
  - question: "Do single page websites load faster?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. A well-optimised multi-page site often loads faster per page than a content-heavy single page site. Single pages can become bloated with images and animations, increasing initial load times significantly."
  - question: "Which website type works better on mobile phones?"
    answer: "Both can work excellently on mobile when properly designed. Single pages benefit from continuous scrolling, while multi-page sites offer clearer navigation. What matters most is responsive design and performance optimisation."
  - question: "Can I have a blog on a single page website?"
    answer: "Technically no—blogs require separate pages by nature. Some single page websites link to an external blog (like Medium), but this dilutes SEO value. If blogging is important for your marketing, choose a multi-page structure."

</aside>

When planning a website for your Perth small business, one of the first decisions you'll face is whether to build a single page (one-page) website or a traditional multi-page site. This choice affects everything from development costs to search engine rankings and user experience.

This guide breaks down the pros and cons of each approach, with specific recommendations for Perth cafés, restaurants, and service businesses.

## Understanding the Difference

### What is a Single Page Website?

A single page website presents all content on one continuous page. Visitors scroll through sections rather than clicking to different pages. Navigation links scroll to different sections on the same page.

**Characteristics:**
- All content on one URL
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Linear storytelling structure
- Simpler navigation

**Common sections on single page sites:**
- Hero/header with key message
- About the business
- Services or menu highlights
- Testimonials/reviews
- Contact form and location

### What is a Multi-Page Website?

A multi-page website has distinct pages for different content, each with its own URL. Visitors click through a menu to access different sections.

**Characteristics:**
- Separate URLs for each page
- Traditional navigation menu
- Non-linear exploration
- Content organised by category

**Common pages:**
- Homepage
- About Us
- Services/Menu (often multiple pages)
- Gallery/Portfolio
- Blog
- Contact

## Comparing the Two Approaches

| Factor | Single Page | Multi-Page |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Development cost | Lower ($2,000-5,000) | Higher ($4,000-15,000+) |
| Ongoing maintenance | Simpler | More complex |
| SEO potential | Limited | Extensive |
| Content capacity | Restricted | Unlimited |
| User journey control | High | Variable |
| Mobile experience | Scroll-focused | Navigation-focused |
| Update frequency | Easier individual updates | More pages to maintain |
| Loading time | Can be longer | Spread across pages |

## When Single Page Websites Work Well

### Perfect for:

**1. Event-Focused Businesses**
- Pop-up restaurants
- Festival vendors
- Special event promotions
- Limited-time offerings

**2. Simple Service Offerings**
- Food trucks with short menus
- Single-location takeaway shops
- Specialised services (only one core offering)
- Personal chef services

**3. Portfolio and Showcase**
- Photographers' work samples
- Artists and designers
- Freelance professionals
- Agency capabilities overview

**4. Landing Pages**
- Marketing campaigns
- Product launches
- Seasonal promotions
- Specific offer pages

### Perth Examples Where Single Page Works

Consider a Fremantle coffee cart that:
- Has 8-10 drinks on the menu
- Operates at one weekend market
- Relies mainly on Instagram for marketing
- Needs basic contact info and location visible

For this business, a single page website with menu, location map, Instagram feed, and contact form covers all needs without unnecessary complexity.

## When Multi-Page Websites Are Better

### Essential for:

**1. SEO-Focused Growth**
- Businesses wanting to rank for multiple keywords
- Venues targeting different suburbs or services
- Companies building long-term organic traffic
- Brands creating content marketing strategies

**2. Complex Service Offerings**
- Restaurants with multiple menus (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Venues with function spaces and catering services
- Businesses offering varied service types
- Companies with multiple locations

**3. Content-Rich Businesses**
- Those planning regular blog content
- Venues with galleries and visual content
- Businesses with detailed service explanations
- Companies with resource libraries

**4. E-commerce Integration**
- Online ordering systems
- Multiple product categories
- Customer account features
- Payment processing needs

### Perth Examples Where Multi-Page Wins

Consider a Mount Lawley restaurant that:
- Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner
- Offers private function space
- Provides catering services
- Has a regularly updated seasonal menu
- Wants to rank for "breakfast Mount Lawley" AND "private dining Perth"

This business needs separate pages to address each offering and capture different search intents.

## SEO Implications: A Critical Difference

The search engine optimisation difference between single and multi-page sites is substantial:

### Single Page SEO Limitations

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| One URL to optimise | Can only target one primary keyword set |
| All content on one page | Difficult to maintain keyword focus |
| No internal linking structure | Misses key SEO signals |
| Limited content depth | Hard to demonstrate topical authority |
| Single meta description | One chance to attract clicks from search results |

### Multi-Page SEO Advantages

**Keyword targeting:**
- Homepage: "Perth restaurant" + brand terms
- Menu page: "Italian food Perth CBD"
- Catering page: "catering services Perth"
- About page: "family restaurant Perth"
- Blog posts: Long-tail and informational keywords

**Technical benefits:**
- Individual page titles and meta descriptions
- Internal linking between related pages
- Better content organisation for crawlers
- More pages indexed = more ranking opportunities

### Real SEO Comparison

For a Perth café targeting local customers:

**Single page approach:**
- Optimise for: "cafe Perth CBD" + "best coffee Perth"
- May rank for 2-3 primary terms

**Multi-page approach:**
- Homepage: "cafe Perth CBD"
- Menu: "breakfast menu Perth"
- Catering: "office catering Perth"
- Blog: "best coffee beans for home"
- May rank for 10+ terms across pages

Over 12-24 months, the multi-page site typically generates significantly more organic traffic if content is properly optimised.

## Cost Analysis for Perth Businesses

### Initial Development Costs

**Single Page Websites:**
- Basic template customisation: $1,500-2,500
- Custom design: $2,500-5,000
- Premium with animations: $4,000-7,000

**Multi-Page Websites:**
- Template-based (5-7 pages): $3,000-6,000
- Custom design (5-7 pages): $6,000-12,000
- Premium with CMS (10+ pages): $10,000-20,000+

### Ongoing Costs

**Annual maintenance comparison:**

| Item | Single Page | Multi-Page |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Hosting | $100-300 | $150-400 |
| Security/updates | $300-600 | $600-1,200 |
| Content updates | $500-1,000 | $1,000-2,500 |
| SEO work | Limited benefit | $2,000-5,000 value |

### Long-Term Value

When considering total cost of ownership over 3-5 years:

**Single page:**
- Lower upfront + lower maintenance = Consistent lower cost
- BUT: Limited SEO returns on investment
- Potential need to rebuild if business grows

**Multi-page:**
- Higher upfront + higher maintenance
- BUT: Compounding SEO value over time
- More scalable as business expands

## User Experience Considerations

### Single Page UX Strengths

**Storytelling control:**
Users follow your intended narrative from top to bottom. You control the flow of information, guiding them toward contact or purchase.

**Mobile simplicity:**
Continuous scrolling feels natural on mobile devices. Users don't need to navigate or wait for new pages to load.

**Focused conversion:**
All roads lead to one call-to-action. Users can't get lost in navigation.

### Single Page UX Weaknesses

**Information overload:**
Long single pages can overwhelm users. If you have substantial content, scrolling fatigue sets in.

**No bookmarking sections:**
Users can't save or share specific content sections directly (though anchor links help somewhat).

**Repeat visit friction:**
Returning users must scroll past familiar content to reach what they need.

### Multi-Page UX Strengths

**Direct access:**
Users can jump straight to what they need—menu, contact, hours—without scrolling through irrelevant content.

**Clearer mental model:**
Traditional website structure feels familiar. Users know how to navigate.

**Better for repeat visitors:**
Regulars can bookmark specific pages (your menu, for example).

### Multi-Page UX Weaknesses

**Navigation dependency:**
Poor navigation design frustrates users. Menus must be intuitive.

**Mobile navigation challenges:**
Hamburger menus can be overlooked. Critical pages may be hidden.

**Drop-off points:**
Each page click is a potential exit point.

## Industry-Specific Recommendations for Perth

### Restaurants and Cafés

**Recommended: Multi-page (4-7 pages)**

**Why:**
- Menus deserve dedicated pages (easier to update, better for search)
- Booking systems work better on separate pages
- Location and hours need prominent, easy access
- Photos and atmosphere deserve gallery space

**Essential pages:**
1. Home (overview + atmosphere)
2. Menu (with PDF download option)
3. Reservations/Book
4. About (story, team, values)
5. Contact + Location
6. Gallery (optional but valuable)

### Bars and Nightclubs

**Recommended: Hybrid or multi-page**

**Why:**
- Event calendars need regular updates
- Drinks menus change frequently
- Atmosphere photography is crucial
- Location and hours are priority information

**Approach:**
A content-rich single page can work if events are promoted via social media, but multi-page allows for event archives and better SEO.

### Food Trucks and Pop-Ups

**Recommended: Single page**

**Why:**
- Simple menu sufficient
- Location varies (social media updates better)
- Low content volume
- Budget efficiency matters

**Essential sections:**
- Hero with brand and USP
- Menu highlights
- Where to find us (or social link)
- Instagram/social feed
- Contact/booking form

### Service Businesses (Tradies, Consultants)

**Recommended: Multi-page (5-10 pages)**

**Why:**
- Multiple services need individual SEO focus
- Case studies and testimonials build trust
- Service areas/suburbs deserve targeting
- Blog potential for expertise demonstration

**Essential pages:**
- Home
- Services (1-3 pages)
- About/Team
- Portfolio/Case Studies
- Service Areas
- Contact
- Blog (recommended)

## Technical Considerations
