faq:
  - question: "How long should I allow for a food photography shoot?"
    answer: "For most Perth restaurants, a <strong>half-day (4 hours) shoot can cover 15–25 dishes</strong>, while a full-day (8 hours) allows for 30–50 dishes plus venue atmosphere shots. Allow extra time if you're shooting complex plated dishes or need multiple setups."
  - question: "Should I prepare more food than needed?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes—always prepare 2–3 versions of each dish.</strong> One is the \"hero\" for photography; others are backups in case of plating issues, wilting, or retakes. This is especially important for dishes with delicate greens or ice cream components."
  - question: "What should my team wear during the shoot?"
    answer: "If team members appear in shots, wear <strong>clean, neutral clothing</strong> without busy patterns or logos (unless intentional branding). Chef whites should be freshly pressed. Avoid bright colours that can reflect onto food."
  - question: "Can I use the kitchen normally during the shoot?"
    answer: "Ideally, <strong>schedule shoots during closed or off-peak hours</strong>. A working kitchen creates noise, movement, and potential for accidental contamination of styled dishes. If shooting during service is unavoidable, designate a separate styling area."
  - question: "Do I need to provide props or does the photographer bring them?"
    answer: "Professional food photographers often carry basic styling tools, but <strong>venue-specific props should come from you</strong>—your plates, napkins, and servingware that match your brand. Discuss prop needs in your pre-shoot call; we can advise on what works best for your dishes."
  - question: "How soon before opening hours should we start the shoot?"
    answer: "Allow <strong>at least 1–2 hours buffer</strong> before opening. This gives time for final cleanup, putting away styling equipment, and transitioning back to service mode. For Perth venues with popular brunch service, early morning starts (7–8am) work well."
  - question: "What happens if a dish doesn't photograph well?"
    answer: "We assess during the shoot and can suggest styling adjustments or alternative plating. Having backup ingredients on hand means we can re-plate quickly. This is why prep and \"hero\" versions are so important—we're prepared for anything."

  Preparing your kitchen for a food photography shoot involves cleaning, organizing, gathering props, planning lighting, and coordinating with your photographer. A well‑prepared kitchen saves time, reduces stress, and results in professional images that can increase menu item sales by up to 30% (see our article on <a href="/blog/roi-professional-food-photography-perth">the ROI of professional food photography</a>). This step‑by‑step guide walks Perth restaurant and café owners through each preparation task to ensure your venue gets stunning, sales‑driving photos.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you're shooting for a new menu, updating your website, or creating content for social media, the effort you put into preparation directly impacts the quality of your final images. In Perth's competitive hospitality scene—from Northbridge to Fremantle, the CBD to suburban Subiaco—where visuals often decide a customer's first impression, getting this right is crucial.

<h2>Step 1 – Clean and Declutter Your Workspace</h2>
<p>
  A clean kitchen isn't just about hygiene—it's about creating a neutral canvas that lets your food be the star. Before the photographer arrives, take time to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear countertops</strong> of all non‑essential equipment, utensils, and personal items.</li>
  <li><strong>Wipe down surfaces</strong> to remove grease, water spots, and fingerprints that can show up in reflections.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide trash bins, cleaning supplies, and storage containers</strong> out of frame.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the floor</strong> for spills or debris that could appear in wide‑angle shots.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean windows</strong> from the inside—dust and smudges affect natural light quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Polish stainless steel</strong> to remove streaks and fingerprints that cameras magnify.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Remember: the camera sees everything. A cluttered background distracts from your dishes and can make your kitchen look unprofessional. For Perth venues, where natural light often highlights dust and smudges, a thorough clean is especially important.
</p>

<h2>Cleaning Checklist for Perth Venues</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Area</th>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Why It Matters</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Countertops</strong></td>
      <td>Degrease, polish, remove all items</td>
      <td>Primary shooting surface; must be spotless</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Windows</strong></td>
      <td>Clean inside and outside if accessible</td>
      <td>Dirty glass reduces light quality</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Stainless steel</strong></td>
      <td>Polish with appropriate cleaner</td>
      <td>Fingerprints and streaks are magnified</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Floors</strong></td>
      <td>Mop, remove mats if distracting</td>
      <td>Visible in wide-angle and low shots</td>

      <td><strong>Dishware</strong></td>
      <td>Inspect for chips, stains, watermarks</td>
      <td>Hero plates must be perfect</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 2 – Gather Your Props and Styling Tools</h2>
<p>
  Professional food photography relies on props to add context and visual interest. Gather these items ahead of time to avoid last‑minute scrambling:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Plates, bowls, and servingware</strong> in various sizes and styles that match your brand.</li>
  <li><strong>Cutlery, napkins, and glassware</strong> that are spotless and free of watermarks.</li>
  <li><strong>Textured linens, wooden boards, or stone slabs</strong> to create different backgrounds.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh herbs, citrus wedges, spices, and other garnishes</strong> that can be added during the shoot.</li>
  <li><strong>Small tools</strong> like tweezers, brushes, and spray bottles for precise styling.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup ingredients</strong> for key dishes in case of plating mishaps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Props Checklist by Venue Type</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Venue Type</th>
      <th>Suggested Props</th>
      <th>Avoid</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Coastal café (Fremantle, Scarborough)</strong></td>
      <td>Light wood, white linen, shells, natural textures</td>
      <td>Dark/industrial elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Fine dining (CBD, Subiaco)</strong></td>
      <td>Matte black, slate, white plates, minimal styling</td>
      <td>Busy patterns, casual props</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Industrial bar (Northbridge)</strong></td>
      <td>Dark wood, metal, concrete, moody textures</td>
      <td>Light/airy styling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Brunch spot (Mount Lawley)</strong></td>
      <td>Colourful plates, fresh flowers, marble, terrazzo</td>
      <td>Dark/moody styling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Asian restaurant</strong></td>
      <td>Ceramic dishes, chopsticks, bamboo, tea sets</td>
      <td>Western-style props</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Italian trattoria</strong></td>
      <td>Rustic wood, checked linen, olive oil, fresh pasta</td>
      <td>Modern minimalist styling</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  If you're unsure which props suit your venue's style, look at [Perth food photography](/blog/before-after-photography-mistakes) trends: coastal cafés often use light, natural materials, while city bars might lean toward dark, industrial textures. Your photographer can also advise on what works best for your dishes. For more styling ideas, see our <a href="/blog/food-photography-tips-restaurants">[food photography tips](/blog/food-photography-tips-restaurants) for restaurants</a>.
</p>

<h2>Step 3 – Plan Your Lighting Setup</h2>
<p>
  Lighting is the single most important factor in food photography. Perth's abundant natural light is a huge advantage, but you need to plan how to use it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify the best window</strong> in your kitchen—ideally one that provides soft, indirect light for most of the day.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid direct sunlight</strong>, which creates harsh shadows and blown‑out highlights. Use sheer curtains or diffusers if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Have backup lighting ready</strong> for evening shoots or cloudy days. Continuous LED panels or softboxes can mimic natural light.</li>
  <li><strong>Turn off overhead fluorescent lights</strong>, which cast unflattering yellow or green tones on food.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule around the sun</strong>—morning light (8–10am) and late afternoon (3–5pm) are often ideal in Perth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Perth Lighting Conditions by Time</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>Light Quality</th>
      <th>Best For</th>
      <th>Cautions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>6–8am</strong></td>
      <td>Soft, warm, golden hour</td>
      <td>Breakfast dishes, café ambiance</td>
      <td>May be too dim indoors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>8–10am</strong></td>
      <td>Bright but soft</td>
      <td>General food photography</td>
      <td>Ideal window</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>10am–2pm</strong></td>
      <td>Harsh overhead sun</td>
      <td>Artificial lighting only</td>
      <td>Strong shadows, hot spots</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>2–5pm</strong></td>
      <td>Softening, warm</td>
      <td>Afternoon dishes, venue atmosphere</td>
      <td>Watch for shifting sun angle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>5–7pm (summer)</strong></td>
      <td>Golden hour, warm</td>
      <td>Outdoor shots, sunset ambiance</td>
      <td>Limited window; work fast</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Discuss lighting with your photographer beforehand. They may bring additional equipment, but knowing your kitchen's light conditions helps them plan the shoot efficiently. For more on lighting, read our article on <a href="/blog/natural-light-vs-artificial-light-perth-cafes">natural vs artificial light for Perth cafés</a>.
</p>

<h2>Step 4 – Organize Your Dishes and Ingredients</h2>
<p>
  A well‑organized shoot flows smoothly and keeps food looking fresh. Create a shot list and sequence dishes logically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Group similar dishes</strong> (e.g., all pasta, all seafood) to reuse styling and lighting setups.</li>
  <li><strong>Start with cold or room‑temperature dishes</strong> that won't wilt or melt under lights.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare ingredients in stages</strong> so everything is at peak freshness when it's time to shoot.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a "hero" version of each dish</strong> reserved solely for photography—untouched by tasting or serving.</li>
  <li><strong>Have backup components</strong> ready for items that wilt quickly (greens, sauces, ice cream).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dish Sequencing for Maximum Freshness</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Shoot Order</th>
      <th>Dish Type</th>
      <th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>First</strong></td>
      <td>Charcuterie, salads, cold appetisers</td>
      <td>Won't degrade under lights</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Second</strong></td>
      <td>Sandwiches, sushi, room-temp dishes</td>
      <td>Stable for longer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Third</strong></td>
      <td>Desserts (non-frozen)</td>
      <td>Stable but can melt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Fourth</strong></td>
      <td>Cooked mains, pasta, grilled items</td>
      <td>Need to capture steam/freshness quickly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Last</strong></td>
      <td>Ice cream, frozen desserts, drinks with ice</td>
      <td>Melt within minutes; shoot immediately</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  For Perth venues, consider seasonal produce availability. Shooting in summer? Highlight local stone fruit, seafood, and salads. In winter, focus on hearty stews, roasted vegetables, and warm desserts. Seasonal WA ingredients not only look fresh—they also resonate with local customers who recognise regional produce.
</p>

<h2>Perth Seasonal Produce Calendar</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Season</th>
      <th>Peak Produce</th>
      <th>Styling Opportunity</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Summer (Dec–Feb)</strong></td>
      <td>Stone fruit, berries, seafood, salads</td>
      <td>Fresh, bright, colourful styling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Autumn (Mar–May)</strong></td>
      <td>Apples, figs, pumpkin, mushrooms</td>
      <td>Warm earth tones, rustic presentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Winter (Jun–Aug)</strong></td>
      <td>Citrus, root vegetables, WA truffles</td>
      <td>Cozy, moody, comfort food styling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Spring (Sep–Nov)</strong></td>
      <td>Asparagus, peas, lamb, wildflowers</td>
      <td>Light, fresh, awakening styling</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 5 – Coordinate with Your Photographer</h2>
<p>
  Clear communication with your photographer ensures everyone is on the same page. Share these details before the shoot:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your shot list</strong> and any must‑have images (e.g., signature dishes, new menu items).</li>
  <li><strong>Your brand style guide</strong> or examples of images you like (and don't like).</li>
  <li><strong>Access and parking information</strong> for your venue, especially in busy Perth suburbs like Northbridge or Fremantle.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact numbers</strong> for the day, plus any kitchen safety or protocol reminders.</li>
  <li><strong>Intended use</strong> for the images—website menu, social media, Google Business Profile, print materials—so they can tailor framing and resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A good photographer will also ask about your goals for the images—website menu, social media, print materials—so they can tailor the shoot accordingly. At Amplify Creative Lab, we combine food photography with web development expertise, meaning we also consider how the images will perform online (loading speed, mobile responsiveness, SEO).

</p>

<h2>Perth‑Specific Considerations</h2>
<p>
  Perth's hospitality scene has unique characteristics that can influence your shoot preparation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Coastal venues</strong> (Fremantle, Scarborough, Cottesloe) often benefit from bright, airy styling that matches their beachside location and abundant natural light.</li>
  <li><strong>City restaurants</strong> (Perth CBD, Northbridge) might prefer darker, moodier lighting to suit an industrial or fine‑dining atmosphere.</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal changes</strong> are more pronounced in WA—plan shoots around local produce peaks for authentic, appealing imagery.</li>
  <li><strong>Local regulations</strong> regarding photography in commercial kitchens (e.g., food‑safety certifications) should be checked beforehand.</li>
  <li><strong>Venue parking</strong> in busy areas like Northbridge or Fremantle may require advance arrangement for equipment loading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Food Shoot Preparation</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>How long should I allow for a food photography shoot?</h3>

<h2>Your Kitchen Ready, Your Images Stunning</h2>

  A successful food shoot is the result of careful preparation. By cleaning your space, gathering props, planning lighting, organizing dishes, and coordinating with your photographer, you create the ideal conditions for capturing images that truly represent your food and your brand.
</p>

<p>
  In a market where customers decide where to eat based on visuals—whether they're scrolling Northbridge options on a Friday night or comparing Fremantle brunch spots—investing time in kitchen preparation pays off with higher‑quality photos that drive engagement, increase orders, and strengthen your online presence across your website, Instagram, Google Business Profile, and delivery platforms.
