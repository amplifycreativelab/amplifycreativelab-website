faq:
  - question: "How much does website speed optimization cost?"
    answer: "For a typical Perth restaurant website, optimization ranges from <strong>$500–$2,000</strong> for improvements to an existing site, or <strong>$3,000–$6,000</strong> for a full rebuild with a performance-first framework like Astro. The investment typically pays for itself within 2–3 months through increased bookings and reduced bounce rates."
  - question: "Can I optimize my existing WordPress site, or do I need a rebuild?"
    answer: "<strong>It depends on the severity of the issues.</strong> Sites with moderate problems (large images, too many plugins) can often be optimized in place. Sites with fundamental architecture issues (heavy themes, database bloat, poor hosting) often benefit more from a rebuild. We assess each case individually during our free audit."
  - question: "How long does speed optimization take?"
    answer: "Optimization of an existing site typically takes <strong>1–2 weeks</strong>. A full rebuild with Astro or similar framework takes <strong>4–6 weeks</strong> including design, development, content migration, and testing."
  - question: "Will improving speed really increase my bookings?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes—the data is clear.</strong> Google reports that 53% of mobile users leave a page that takes over 3 seconds to load. Each second of improvement can increase conversions by 7–10%. This case study showed a 42% booking increase directly attributed to speed improvements."
  - question: "What are the most important Core Web Vitals to fix first?"
    answer: "<strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong> has the biggest impact on perceived speed and is usually the easiest to improve through image optimization. <strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</strong> affects user frustration directly. <strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</strong> matters most for interactive elements like booking forms."
  - question: "Does this work for restaurants in other Perth suburbs?"
    answer: "<strong>Absolutely.</strong> The same principles apply whether you're in Northbridge, Fremantle, Mount Lawley, or the outer suburbs. The specific context differs (urban vs suburban, tourist vs local audience), but the technical optimizations—image pipeline, modern framework, edge hosting—deliver results everywhere."
  - question: "How do I know if my website has speed problems?"
    answer: "Run your site through <strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> (free). If your Lighthouse Performance score is below 70, or any Core Web Vital shows red/orange, you have optimization opportunities. If mobile load time exceeds 3 seconds, you're losing potential customers."

<h2>The Problem: A Slow Website Was Driving Hungry Customers Away</h2>
<p>
  The venue, a popular family‑focused restaurant in Success, was struggling with a website that took 8–12 seconds to load on mobile. Despite having a great menu and positive reviews, the digital experience was frustrating potential diners:

      <td>1.8 seconds</td>
      <td>Server response delay</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extreme bounce rates:</strong> 68% of mobile visitors left before the page finished loading, costing the restaurant an estimated 30 lost bookings per week.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor Core Web Vitals:</strong> Google Lighthouse scored the site 32/100 for performance, with a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of 9.2 seconds and a Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) of 0.45.</li>
  <li><strong>Inefficient images:</strong> Unoptimized hero images (each over 2 MB) were the primary cause of slow loading, especially on mobile data.</li>
  <li><strong>Outdated technology stack:</strong> The site was built on a generic WordPress theme with 40+ plugins, many of which were unused but still adding HTTP requests and JavaScript bloat.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The restaurant's analytics revealed that <strong>mobile traffic accounted for 82% of all website visits</strong>, yet the average load time on 4G was 9.1 seconds—well above the 3‑second threshold where 40% of users abandon a site.
</p>

<h2>The Solution: A Performance‑First Overhaul</h2>
<p>
  We partnered with the restaurant to rebuild their website with speed as the primary design constraint. The goal was to achieve sub‑2‑second loads on mobile while preserving the visual appeal and functionality they needed.
</p>

      <td>Edge hosting with built-in caching</td>
      <td>TTFB from 1.8s to 180ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Migration to Astro:</strong> We replaced the bloated WordPress theme with a lightweight static site built using Astro, eliminating unnecessary database queries and reducing JavaScript by 90%.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced image pipeline:</strong> Every image was resized, converted to WebP, and served via a global CDN with responsive srcsets, cutting total image weight by 84%.</li>
  <li><strong>Critical CSS & lazy loading:</strong> We inlined critical CSS, deferred non‑essential JavaScript, and lazy‑loaded below‑the‑fold content to ensure the page became interactive almost instantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting & CDN upgrade:</strong> The site was moved to a high‑performance edge‑hosting platform with built‑in caching, reducing Time‑to‑First‑Byte (TTFB) from 1.8 s to 180 ms.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The new site retained all the essential features—online bookings, menu display, location map, and photo gallery—but delivered them in a fraction of the time.

<h3>1. Performance Audit & Benchmarking</h3>
<p>
  We used Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and real‑user monitoring (RUM) data to identify the biggest bottlenecks. The audit showed that images accounted for 73% of the page weight, and render‑blocking JavaScript delayed the First Contentful Paint by 4.5 seconds.
</p>

<h3>2. Technology Stack Evaluation</h3>
<p>
  After comparing WordPress, Astro, and other static‑site generators, we chose Astro for its near‑zero JavaScript overhead and excellent built‑in image optimization. The decision was also influenced by the restaurant's simple content needs—no dynamic user interactions beyond a booking form. (See our comparison in <a href="/blog/astro-vs-wordpress-hospitality-websites-perth">Astro vs WordPress for Hospitality Websites</a>.)
</p>

<h3>3. Image Optimization & Delivery</h3>
<p>
  Our photography team reprocessed all existing menu and gallery images, exporting them at multiple breakpoints (400px, 800px, 1200px) in WebP format. We implemented Astro's <code>&lt;Image /&gt;</code> component to automatically serve the correct size and format, and set up a CDN to cache images globally.

<h3>4. Code Splitting & Asset Minimization</h3>
<p>
  We removed unused CSS, split JavaScript into critical and deferred bundles, and adopted modern ES modules. Third‑party scripts (like Google Maps and booking widgets) were loaded only after the main content had painted.
</p>

<h3>5. Testing & Validation</h3>
<p>
  Before launch, we tested the site across 30+ real devices and network profiles (from 3G to fibre). We also ran continuous Lighthouse checks to ensure Core Web Vitals stayed in the "green" zone. After launch, we monitored performance with SpeedCurve and observed real‑user metrics via CrUX data.
</p>

<h2>Measurable Results: The Numbers Speak</h2>
<p>
  Within four months of launching the optimized site, the restaurant saw dramatic improvements across every performance and business metric:

<p>
  The improved performance also translated into higher customer satisfaction. Post‑launch surveys showed that <strong>94% of diners found the new website "much faster and easier to use"</strong> on their phones, and 81% said the speed made them more likely to book a table directly instead of calling.

<p><strong>Payback period: Under 3 months.</strong> The ongoing benefits (improved SEO, reduced bounce rate, higher conversion) continue to compound.</p>

<h2>Why Speed Matters for Success Restaurants</h2>
<p>
  Success is a family‑oriented suburb in Perth's southern corridor where many diners use their phones to find and book restaurants while on the go—often from Cockburn Gateway, the local shopping centre, or after visiting nearby attractions. Patchy mobile coverage in some areas makes fast‑loading websites even more critical. A site that loads instantly, displays menus clearly, and allows quick booking isn't just a convenience—it's a competitive edge.
</p>

<p>
  The optimization succeeded because it addressed three specific needs of the Success market:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mobile‑first performance:</strong> With many locals using smartphones on 4G/5G networks, a fast‑loading site reduces frustration and keeps potential customers engaged.</li>
  <li><strong>Local SEO advantage:</strong> Google's page‑experience update prioritizes fast sites in local search results, helping the restaurant appear higher for queries like "family restaurant Success" or "best pizza near me."</li>
  <li><strong>Visual appeal without the weight:</strong> High‑quality food photography is essential, but it must be delivered efficiently. Our image pipeline ensured stunning visuals without slowing down the page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions: [Website Speed Optimization](/blog/why-perth-restaurants-lose-bookings-to-slow-sites)</h2>

<aside className="faq-section">
  <h3>How much does website speed optimization cost?</h3>
  <p>
    For a typical [Perth restaurant website](/blog/menu-redesign-case-study-perth-restaurant-bookings), optimization ranges from <strong>$500–$2,000</strong> for improvements to an existing site, or <strong>$3,000–$6,000</strong> for a full rebuild with a performance-first framework like Astro. The investment typically pays for itself within 2–3 months through increased bookings and reduced bounce rates.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I optimize my existing WordPress site, or do I need a rebuild?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>It depends on the severity of the issues.</strong> Sites with moderate problems (large images, too many plugins) can often be optimized in place. Sites with fundamental architecture issues (heavy themes, database bloat, poor hosting) often benefit more from a rebuild. We assess each case individually during our free audit.
  </p>

  <h3>How long does speed optimization take?</h3>
  <p>
    Optimization of an existing site typically takes <strong>1–2 weeks</strong>. A full rebuild with Astro or similar framework takes <strong>4–6 weeks</strong> including design, development, content migration, and testing.
  </p>

  <h3>Will improving speed really increase my bookings?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Yes—the data is clear.</strong> Google reports that 53% of mobile users leave a page that takes over 3 seconds to load. Each second of improvement can increase conversions by 7–10%. This case study showed a 42% booking increase directly attributed to speed improvements.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the most important Core Web Vitals to fix first?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong> has the biggest impact on perceived speed and is usually the easiest to improve through image optimization. <strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</strong> affects user frustration directly. <strong>INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</strong> matters most for interactive elements like booking forms.
  </p>

  <h3>Does this work for restaurants in other Perth suburbs?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Absolutely.</strong> The same principles apply whether you're in Northbridge, Fremantle, Mount Lawley, or the outer suburbs. The specific context differs (urban vs suburban, tourist vs local audience), but the technical optimizations—image pipeline, modern framework, edge hosting—deliver results everywhere.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I know if my website has speed problems?</h3>
  <p>
    Run your site through <strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> (free). If your Lighthouse Performance score is below 70, or any Core Web Vital shows red/orange, you have optimization opportunities. If mobile load time exceeds 3 seconds, you're losing potential customers.
  </p>
</aside>

<h2>Key Takeaways for Other Hospitality Businesses</h2>
<p>
  This case study demonstrates that a performance‑focused website overhaul can deliver substantial returns. The core lessons for other Perth hospitality businesses are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Measure Core Web Vitals regularly:</strong> Use Google Search Console and Lighthouse to track LCP, CLS, and INP. If any are in the "red," you're losing bookings. (Learn more in our pillar article <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization-perth">Speed Kills (Competition): Why Fast Websites Get More Bookings</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize images aggressively:</strong> Images are the largest performance bottleneck for most restaurant sites. Convert to WebP, serve responsive sizes, and use a CDN. (See how image optimization impacts SEO in <a href="/blog/how-image-compression-impacts-seo-why-photographers-get-it-wrong">How Image Compression Impacts SEO & Why Photographers Get It Wrong</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>Consider a static‑site generator:</strong> For simple brochure‑style sites, static HTML (like Astro) is faster, more secure, and cheaper to host than a dynamic CMS. (Compare options in <a href="/blog/astro-vs-wordpress-hospitality-websites-perth">Astro vs WordPress for Hospitality Websites: A Perth‑Focused Comparison</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>Test on real networks and devices:</strong> Lab tools like Lighthouse are helpful, but real‑user monitoring reveals the true experience of your customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ready to Speed Up Your Restaurant Website?</h2>
<p>
  If your restaurant's website takes more than 3 seconds to load on mobile, you're missing out on bookings, higher search visibility, and better customer satisfaction. The good news is that many performance issues can be fixed without a full rebuild—we can often optimize your existing site in a matter of days.
