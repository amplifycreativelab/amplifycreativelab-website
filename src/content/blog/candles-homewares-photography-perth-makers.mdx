faq:
  - question: "How much does professional candle photography cost in Perth?"
    answer: "Professional candle photography in Perth typically ranges from $40-100 per product for basic e-commerce shots, $100-300 for styled hero images, and $1,500-5,000 for complete brand campaigns. Bulk packages for 20+ products offer significant savings—often 30-40% off individual rates."
  - question: "How do I photograph candles without showing the flame?"
    answer: "Most e-commerce and promotional candle photography shows unlit candles to display wax colour, vessel details, and branding. For lifestyle shots with flames, use long exposures (1/15-1/60 second) in low ambient light, or composite multiple exposures. LED fake candles can substitute for consistency."
  - question: "What background works best for candle product photography?"
    answer: "White backgrounds work for e-commerce consistency, but lifestyle shots benefit from natural textures—timber, stone, linen, or concrete. Match backgrounds to your brand aesthetic: rustic textures for natural brands, clean marble for luxury positioning, warm tones for cozy home messaging."
  - question: "How do I capture the texture of handmade ceramics in photos?"
    answer: "Side lighting reveals texture best—position your light source at 45-90 degrees from the camera. Avoid flat, frontal lighting which flattens texture. Get close with macro details and shoot at multiple angles to show imperfections and handmade character that buyers value."
  - question: "Can I photograph my own homewares products with a smartphone?"
    answer: "Modern smartphones can produce quality results for social media and market stalls. However, professional photography is essential for e-commerce stores, wholesale pitches, and marketing materials where poor imagery directly impacts sales conversions and brand perception."
  - question: "How many photos do I need per product for e-commerce?"
    answer: "Plan for 4-6 images per product: front view, back/label, 45-degree angle, scale reference (with common object or dimensions shown), detail/texture shot, and lifestyle context. Collections benefit from group shots showing the range together."
  - question: "What props should I use for candle photography in Perth?"
    answer: "Native Australian botanicals work beautifully—dried banksia, eucalyptus, native grasses. Natural textures like WA timber, Perth sandstone, and raw linen complement handmade aesthetics. Keep props minimal to avoid competing with your product—they should enhance, not dominate."
  - question: "How do I photograph glass candle vessels without reflections?"
    answer: "Use large, diffused light sources positioned above and behind the product. Black cards (flags) on either side control reflections. Shoot in a tidy environment as glass reflects everything. Some post-processing is typically needed to clean up remaining reflections."

Perth's maker community is thriving, from Margaret River candle studios to Fremantle ceramicists and suburban homewares artisans selling through markets and online stores. Whether you're selling soy candles at local markets, wholesaling ceramics to boutiques, or running a Shopify store, professional product photography is essential for success.

This guide covers everything Perth candle makers and homewares artisans need to know about capturing products that sell—from technical photography considerations to styling that connects with your target market.

## Why Product Photography Matters for Makers

The statistics for handmade goods are compelling:

| Statistic | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 93% of consumers say visual appearance is the key deciding factor in purchases | Image quality directly affects sales |
| Products with lifestyle imagery see 40% higher engagement | Context helps buyers envision products in their homes |
| Poor photography is cited as a top reason for cart abandonment | Unprofessional images lower perceived product value |
| Professional imagery justifies premium pricing | Handmade deserves to look handmade, not amateur |

For artisan products specifically, photography must convey:
- Handcrafted quality and intentional imperfections
- Material texture and authenticity
- Scale and proportion in real-world context
- Brand story and maker values

## Types of Candle and Homewares Photography

### 1. E-commerce Product Shots

**Purpose:** Primary listing images for online stores

**Characteristics:**
- Clean, consistent backgrounds (white or neutral)
- Multiple angles per product
- Label and branding clearly visible
- Accurate colour representation
- Size reference or dimensions shown

These are your foundational images—used for product listings, catalogues, and wholesale sheets.

### 2. Lifestyle and Contextual Photography

**Purpose:** Marketing, social media, homepage features

**Characteristics:**
- Products styled in real-world settings
- Home environment context (living room, bathroom, bedroom)
- Seasonal and mood-appropriate styling
- Tells a story about product use
- Creates emotional connection with buyers

Lifestyle images help customers imagine your products in their own homes.

### 3. Hero and Campaign Imagery

**Purpose:** Brand campaigns, advertising, press

**Characteristics:**
- Dramatic lighting and composition
- Strong brand story communication
- Higher production value
- Often includes models or hands interacting with products
- Magazine-quality aesthetics

These are your showpiece images for major marketing moments.

### 4. Flat Lay and Collection Shots

**Purpose:** Range overviews, gift sets, social content

**Characteristics:**
- Top-down perspective
- Multiple products arranged artfully
- Popular for Instagram and Pinterest
- Great for showing scent families or colour ranges
- Seasonal collections and gift guides

### 5. Detail and Texture Shots

**Purpose:** Showing craftsmanship and material quality

**Characteristics:**
- Macro close-ups of texture
- Wick details for candles
- Glaze variations for ceramics
- Raw material integration (beeswax, clay)
- Handmade character highlighted

## Photography Challenges for Candles and Homewares

### Photographing Candles

**Wax texture capture:**
Different wax types photograph differently:
- Soy wax: Creamy, sometimes with natural "frosting" that needs faithful representation
- Beeswax: Golden tones requiring accurate colour balance
- Coconut blends: Smooth, white surfaces that can blow out in highlights

**Glass vessel challenges:**
- Reflections from every surface
- Transparency showing fill levels
- Labels that may be reflective
- Inner wax colour visible through glass

**Technical solutions:**
- Large diffused light sources
- Black flags to control reflections
- Gradient backgrounds for transparent vessels
- Multiple exposure compositing when needed

### Photographing Ceramics

**Texture is everything:**
Handmade ceramics have intentional imperfections that buyers specifically value. Your photography must:
- Reveal texture through side lighting
- Show glaze variations honestly
- Capture the depth of glazes
- Highlight rather than hide "imperfections"

**Form and dimension:**
Round pottery can look flat in photos. Techniques to show dimension:
- Angular lighting creating shadows
- Multiple angles per piece
- Scale references for context
- Background elements creating depth

**Colour accuracy:**
Glaze colours must be accurate—customers receiving products that don't match photos will return them and leave negative reviews.

### Photographing General Homewares

**Material diversity:**
A single maker might create products in wood, metal, fabric, and glass—each requiring different approaches:

| Material | Lighting Approach |
|----------|-------------------|
| Wood | Side lighting shows grain, warm white balance |
| Metal | Careful reflection control, often needs compositing |
| Fabric/textiles | Soft lighting, texture requires angled light |
| Glass | Gradient backgrounds, reflection management |
| Mixed materials | Multiple lighting setups or compromise approach |

## Styling for Perth Makers

### Using Western Australian Elements

Local makers can differentiate with WA-inspired styling:

**Natural props:**
- Native Australian botanicals (banksia, protea, eucalyptus)
- Dried wildflowers (especially for spring/summer)
- WA timber offcuts and recycled jarrah
- Coastal elements (shells, driftwood, sand)
- Kimberley ochres and Perth sandstone

**Local backdrops:**
- Perth's famous natural light quality
- WA landscape colour palettes (coastal blues, bush greens, earth ochres)
- Recycled and sustainable materials reflecting eco-conscious values
- Urban textures from Fremantle warehouses and heritage buildings

### Brand Story Through Styling

Your photography should communicate your values:

| Brand Position | Styling Approach |
|----------------|------------------|
| Sustainable/eco | Recycled surfaces, native plants, earth tones |
| Luxury/gift | Marble, brass accents, minimal elegant props |
| Coastal/beach | Driftwood, shells, soft blues and naturals |
| Rustic/farmhouse | Raw timber, linen, dried flowers, warm tones |
| Modern/minimalist | Clean lines, geometric shapes, monochrome palette |

### Scent Representation for Candles

You can't photograph scent, but you can suggest it:

| Scent Family | Visual Props |
|--------------|--------------|
| Citrus | Lemon slices, orange peel, green leaves |
| Floral | Fresh or dried flowers matching the scent |
| Woodsy | Timber, bark, pine cones, eucalyptus |
| Ocean/fresh | Blue accents, sea glass, coastal elements |
| Spice | Cinnamon sticks, vanilla pods, star anise |
| Herbal | Fresh herbs, lavender, rosemary sprigs |

**Important:** Only include prop elements that accurately represent your scent. Misleading imagery damages trust.

## Planning Your Product Photography

### Pre-Production Checklist

**Product preparation:**
- [ ] Clean all products thoroughly (fingerprints show in photos)
- [ ] Check candle wicks are trimmed and centred
- [ ] Ensure labels are straight and bubble-free
- [ ] Remove any dust or debris
- [ ] Have multiples of hero products (damage happens)

**Brand assets needed:**
- [ ] Brand guidelines (colours, mood, values)
- [ ] Competitor imagery for reference and differentiation
- [ ] Shot list with all required angles
- [ ] Platform specifications (dimensions, file types)

**Styling preparation:**
- [ ] Props sourced and cleaned
- [ ] Backgrounds prepared or surfaces organised
- [ ] Seasonal elements if relevant
- [ ] Test arrangements before shoot day

### Shot List Development

**Per product (minimum 4, aim for 6):**
1. Front-facing hero shot (primary listing image)
2. Back view (label, ingredients, weight visible)
3. 45-degree angle (showing dimension)
4. Scale/size reference
5. Detail shot (texture, wick, unique features)
6. Lifestyle context (in-home setting)

**For candle lines:**
- Unlit product shots (primary)
- Collection groupings by scent family
- Optional lit ambiance shots for marketing

**For ceramics:**
- Overhead shots showing opening/interior
- Side views showing form
- Base detail if notable
- Grouped range shots

### Image Quantities Planning

| Sales Channel | Images Needed Per SKU |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Etsy | 8-10 images recommended |
| Shopify | 4-6 minimum, more is better |
| Wholesale pitches | 2-3 professional hero shots |
| Markets/stalls | 2-3 for signage and social |
| Social media | Ongoing lifestyle library |

## DIY vs. Professional Photography

### When DIY Can Work

**Suitable for:**
- Behind-the-scenes social content
- Stories and casual updates
- Testing product concepts
- Small market stalls with limited budgets
- Process and making-of content

**DIY requirements:**
- Good natural light (north-facing window)
- Clean, consistent backgrounds
- Basic phone editing skills
- Time to learn and practice

### When to Invest in Professional

**Essential for:**
- E-commerce store launch or refresh
- Wholesale buyer presentations
- Retailers and stockists submissions
- Marketing campaigns and advertising
- Press kits and media outreach
- Etsy or online marketplace optimisation

The return on professional photography is measurable—products with quality imagery consistently outperform those with amateur photos in A/B testing.

### Cost Comparison

| Approach | Initial Cost | Ongoing Value |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Smartphone DIY | $0-200 (tools) | Low conversion rates |
| Entry DSLR + learning | $1,000-2,000 | Mixed results, time-intensive |
| Professional shoot | $800-3,000 | Higher conversions, brand elevation |

For most Perth makers selling 20+ products, professional photography pays for itself within months through improved sales.

## E-commerce Platform Requirements

| Platform | Recommended Size | Background | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------|
| Etsy | 2000 x 2000px | Any, consistent | 8-10 images ideal |
| Shopify | 2048 x 2048px | White/neutral | Square format |
| Instagram Shop | 1080 x 1080px | Any | Link to full listings |
| Faire (wholesale) | 2000 x 2000px | White | Professional essential |
| Market stall signage | 300dpi for print | Any | Large format printing |

**Pro tip:** Always shoot at maximum resolution—you can downsize but never upgrade quality.

## Perth-Specific Photography Considerations

### Studio vs. Home Shoots

**Studio advantages:**
- Consistent, controlled lighting
- Professional backdrops and surfaces
- Efficient multi-product sessions

**Location advantages:**

### Working with Perth's Natural Light

Perth's clear, bright light is an asset:
- North-facing windows provide consistent indirect light

- Avoid harsh midday direct sun
- Overcast days provide excellent diffused light

**Seasonal considerations:**
- Summer: Early morning shoots avoid harsh light
- Winter: Midday may offer best natural light
- Spring: Wildflower season for prop opportunities
- Autumn: Warm tones suit cozy candle marketing
