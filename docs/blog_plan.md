GLOBAL SEO & STYLE GUIDELINES (For Developers/Writers)
------------------------------------------------------

*   **Tone of Voice:** Professional, authoritative, yet approachable._Positioning:_ “We are the tech-savvy artists” – we understand both visuals _and_ code.
    
*   **Personas to Keep in Mind:**
    
    *   **Restaurant Owner:** Wants more bookings, better online presence, and clear ROI.
        
    *   **Café Manager:** Needs better menu photos, Instagram-ready visuals, and a simple website that’s easy to update.
        
    *   **Venue / Event Manager:** Needs launch/event coverage, landing pages, and long-tail content from photos.
        
    *   **Product Founder (CPG/Food Brand):** Needs packshots, e-commerce-ready imagery, and a conversion-driven site.
        
*   **Search Intent Types We Target:**
    
    *   **Informational:** “How to improve restaurant website”, “food photography tips”.
        
    *   **Commercial Intent:** “Perth restaurant web design pricing”, “hire food photographer Perth”.
        
    *   **Local SEO:** “restaurant web design Perth”, “food photographer Fremantle”.
        
    *   **Case Study / Proof:** “before and after food photography”, “website speed case study”.
        
*   **Location Strategy:** Use local variants naturally:
    
    *   “Perth hospitality”, “Northbridge cafés”, “Fremantle restaurants”, “WA food scene”, “Perth venues”, “Perth bars”.
        
*   **Image Optimization Standards:**
    *   All blog images must use Astro's `<Image />` component from `astro:assets` (hero + inline) instead of raw `<img>` tags.
    
    
    *   Format: **WebP** (fallback to JPG as needed).
        
    *   Dimensions:
        
        *   Hero: Max width ~1920px.
            
        *   Body images: Up to ~800–900px wide.
            
    *   Compression: Lossy, ~80–85% quality.
        
    *   **CRITICAL:** All images **must** have descriptive, human-readable alt text that naturally includes local/hospitality keywords where relevant. The user will create the image, just use a random image from the asset folder
        
    *   **🆕 GEO Update (Image Filenames):** Do not use generic names like DSC001.jpg. Use descriptive, entity-rich names: crispy-pork-belly-northbridge-restaurant.webp.
        
*   **Structural Guidelines:**
    
    *   Intro: 1–2 short paragraphs clearly stating the problem for Perth venues.
        
    *   Use h2 for main sections, h3 for sub-sections.
        
    *   Paragraphs: 2–4 sentences max (for readability).
        
    *   Use **and _on key buying phrases (e.g. _Perth restaurant website_, _food photography shoot_, _Core Web Vitals_), not random words._**
        
    *   **_**🆕 AEO Update (The Direct Answer Block):** The first 100 words of every article must directly answer the core user query to target Google "Featured Snippets."_**
        
    *   **_**🆕 AEO Update (Definition Lists):** Use
        
        tags or bold bullet points when defining technical terms (e.g., LCP, SEO, Responsive). AI bots prioritize clear definitions.
        
        _**
        
    *   **_**🆕 GEO Update (The Data Hook):** Every article must include at least one concrete data point or statistic (e.g., "40% of users bounce if a site loads >3s")._**
        
*   **_**Call to Action (CTA):**_**
    
    *   **_Every article must end with:_**
        
        *   **_A **clear textual CTA** in the body (e.g., “Book a free menu audit”)._**
            
        *   **_A link to the **most relevant service page** or /#work-with-us so there is always a concrete next step._**
            
    *   **_Recommended recurring CTAs:_**
        
        *   **_“Book a free menu audit”_**

**_ARTICLE 1: THE REVENUE PILLAR (Web Design Focus)_**
------------------------------------------------------

**_**Status:** ✅ Live as src/content/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo.mdx._**

**_**Concept:** Attack the “PDF Menu” problem. It is the #1 issue for users and bad for SEO. This highlights your web development skills and the value of mobile-first design._**

### **_1\. Metadata_**

*   **_**Proposed Title:** Why Your PDF Menu is Killing Your Google Ranking (And What to Use Instead)_**
    
*   **_**URL Slug:** /blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo_**
    
*   **_**Target Keyword:** Restaurant web design Perth, Mobile friendly menu, SEO for cafes_**
    
*   **_**Meta Description:**Still using a PDF menu for your Perth restaurant? Learn why it hurts your SEO and frustrates diners, and how a responsive web menu drives more bookings._**
    

### **_2\. Content Outline_**

*   **_**H1:** The "PDF Pinch": Why Mobile Diners Hate Your Current Menu_**
    
*   **_**Intro:**Hook the reader with a scenario: A hungry customer in Northbridge tries to load your menu on 4G. It’s a tiny PDF, they have to pinch-zoom, it takes ages to download, they get frustrated and tap on a competitor instead._**
    
    *   **_**🆕 AEO Direct Answer Insertion:** Immediately following the hook, insert a definition box: _"What is a responsive menu? A responsive menu is a webpage written in HTML code that automatically adjusts layout for mobile screens, allowing Google to read the text, unlike a static PDF image."__**
        
*   **_**H2: The SEO Problem with PDFs**_**
    
    *   **_Explain that Google cannot easily "read" individual dishes inside an image-based PDF._**
        
    *   **_Explain that PDF clicks often behave like a “dead end” and can look like a bounce in analytics._**
        
    *   **_Mention how PDFs rarely support structured data (no proper Menu schema, no per-dish visibility)._**
        
*   **_**H2: The User Experience (UX) Nightmare**_**
    
    *   **_Data point angle: a high percentage of restaurant searches happen on mobile._**
        
    *   **_PDFs require downloading extra data (bad for tourists, mobile data caps, weak reception)._**
        
    *   **_Accessibility issues: small text, pinch-zooming, poor readability in bright daylight._**
        
    *   **_Framing: "You’re making hungry people work too hard to give you money."_**
        
    *   **_**🆕 GEO Update (The QR Code Connection):** Add a specific subsection explaining why scanning a QR code just to download a PDF file is a specific UX failure that leads to higher bounce rates compared to a QR code that opens a web link._**
        
*   **_**H2: The Solution – HTML/Responsive Menus**_**
    
    *   **_Explain how you build menus directly into the site’s code, grouped by section (Starters, Mains, Desserts, Drinks)._**
        
    *   **_Benefits:_**
        
        *   **_Fast loading, no downloads._**
            
        *   **_Searchable text (great for SEO & “gluten free pizza in Perth” type queries)._**
            
        *   **_Easier to update prices and seasonal items._**
            
        *   **_Better accessibility (larger text, contrast, headings)._**

        *   **_Highlighting best-sellers and chef’s recommendations._**
            
    *   **_Upsell: you can handle both the design and the food photography, so there’s no gap between visuals and implementation._**
        
*   **_**Conclusion:**Wrap up with the idea: “Stop making your customers pinch-zoom to see your food. A mobile-first menu is one of the simplest ways to get more bookings.”_**
    
*   **_**CTA:**“Need to convert your PDF into a mobile-first website? [Book a free menu audit](https://www.google.com/search?q=/#work-with-us) and we’ll review your current site and menu.”_**

**_**_REPO-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (ASTRO BLOG SYSTEM)_**_**
==================================================================

> **_**_Note: The live site now uses Astro Content Collections (src/content/blog/\*.mdx) and the dynamic route src/pages/blog/\[slug\].astro. The legacy notes below describe the earlier .astro-per-post setup but are still useful for understanding layout responsibilities._**_**

**_**_1\. Blog File Structure_**_**
-----------------------------------

*   **_**_All blog posts are .astro files in src/pages/blog/._**_**
    
    *   **_**_Example: food-photography-tips-restaurants.astro → /blog/food-photography-tips-restaurants/_**_**
        
*   **_**_Use .astro posts (not .md) so we can control:_**_**
    
    *   **_**_Layout_**_**
        
    *   **_**_Metadata_**_**
        
    *   **_**_Schema via BlogPostLayout.astro_**_**
        
*   **_**_Slugs: short, descriptive, lower-case with hyphens:_**_**
    
    *   **_**_pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-seo.astro_**_**
        
    *   **_**_website-speed-optimization-perth.astro_**_**
        
    *   **_**_roi-professional-food-photography-perth.astro, etc._**_**
        

**_**_2\. Mapping This Plan to BlogPostLayout.astro_**_**
---------------------------------------------------------

**_**_Every article defines its metadata in the frontmatter of the .mdx file, and src/pages/blog/\[slug\].astro passes those fields into . Map planning fields to frontmatter/props like this:_**_**

*   **_**_**Title** → title_**_**
    
    *   **_**_Use a clear, benefit-driven headline. This is also used as the hero  alt._**_**
        
*   **_**_**Meta Description** → description_**_**
    
    *   **_**_Aim for ~140–155 characters; front-load “Perth”, “restaurant”, “café”, “web design”, “food photography” etc._**_**
        
*   **_**_**Publish Date** → publishDate in YYYY-MM-DD format._**_**
    
*   **_**_**Category** → category_**_**
    
    *   **_**_Suggested categories (choose one per article):_**_**
          
          *   **_**_Web Design_**_**
              
          *   **_**_Food Photography_**_**
              
          *   **_**_Product Photography_**_**
              
          *   **_**_Event Photography_**_**
              
          *   **_**_Digital Marketing_**_**
              
          *   **_**_Performance_**_**
            
*   **_**_**Read Time** → readTime such as "6 min read" or "8 min read"._**_**
    
*   **_**_**Hero Image URL** → featuredImage (e.g. /images/blog/pdf-vs-digital-menu-perth-hero.jpg)._**_**
    
*   **_**_**Tags** → tags array mixing topic + intent + location, for example:_**_**
    
      *   **_**_\["Restaurant Web Design", "Mobile Menus", "Perth Hospitality"\]_**_**
        
    *   **_**_\["Food Photography", "Restaurant Marketing", "Perth Cafes"\]_**_**
        
*   **_**_TypeScriptconst canonicalUrl = new URL( "/blog/your-article-slug/", "https://amplifycreativelab.com").toString();_**_**
    

**_**_IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR DEVSFramework Recommendation (Astro Content Collections):_**_**

**_**_Current setup: Blog posts use Astro Content Collections at src/content/blog/\*.mdx (already implemented)._**_**

**_**_Why? It allows you to enforce a schema (Title, Date, Image, Description) so you never break your SEO data. It scales better as the blog grows._**_**

**_**_Schema Markup (JSON-LD):_**_**

**_**_Ensure every article defines accurate title, description, publishDate, and canonicalUrl._**_**

**_**_For Article 1 and Article 2, consider adding FAQPage schema if you include a Q&A section._**_**

**_**_The  Component (Crucial):_**_**

**_**_Do not use standard HTML  tags for blog content._**_**

**_**_Use Astro's  component._**_**

**_**_Benefit: It automatically generates the correct width/height to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)—a key point in Article 4._**_**

**_**_Internal Linking Strategy:_**_**

**_**_Web design/speed topics: Link to https://www.google.com/search?q=/website-development. Anchor text: “Perth restaurant website design”, “mobile-first online menus”._**_**

**_**_Photography topics: Link to https://www.google.com/search?q=/perth-food-photography or /portfolio._**_**

**_**_Launch topics: Link to /perth-product-photography or /perth-event-photography._**_**

**_**_Cross-linking: Speed articles must link to PDF menu articles; Photography articles must link to Technical optimization articles._**_**

**_**_On-Page Formatting:_**_**

**_**_Use semantic HTML (ul, ol, h2, h3)._**_**

**_**_Use **on key commercial phrases for scanning, but don't overdo it.**_**_**

**_**_**Always end with a body CTA sentence + link.**_**_**
